intelligence al index report 2024 introduction to the al index report 2024 welcome to the seventh edition of the al index report. the 2024 index is our most comprehensive to date and arrives at an important moment when al’s influence on society has never been more pronounced. this year, we have broadened our scope to more extensively cover essential trends such as technical advancements in al, public perceptions of the technology, and the geopolitical dynamics surrounding its development. featuring more original data than ever before, this edition introduces new estimates on al training costs, detailed analyses of the responsible al landscape, and an entirely new chapter dedicated to al’s impact on science and medicine. the al index report tracks, collates, distills, and visualizes data related to artificial intelligence (al). our mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the complex field of al. the al index is recognized globally as one of the most credible and authoritative sources for data and insights on artificial intelligence. previous editions have been cited in major newspapers, including the the new york times, bloomberg, and the guardian, have amassed hundreds of academic citations, and been referenced by high-level policymakers in the united states, the united kingdom, and the european union, among other places. this year’s edition surpasses all previous ones in size, scale, and scope, reflecting the growing significance that al is coming to hold in all of our lives. ***pdf page 3*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 message from the co-directors a decade ago, the best al systems in the world were unable to classify objects in images at a human level. al struggled with language comprehension and could not solve math problems. today, al systems routinely exceed human performance on standard benchmarks. progress accelerated in 2023. new state-of-the-art systems like gpt-4, gemini, and claude 3 are impressively multimodal: they can generate fluent text in dozens of languages, process audio, and even explain memes. as al has improved, it has increasingly forced its way into our lives. companies are racing to build al-based products, and al is increasingly being used by the general public. but current al technology still has significant problems. it cannot reliably deal with facts, perform complex reasoning, or explain its conclusions. al faces two interrelated futures. first, technology continues to improve and is increasingly used, having major consequences for productivity and employment. it can be put to both good and bad uses. in the second future, the adoption of al is constrained by the limitations of the technology. regardless of which future unfolds, governments are increasingly concerned. they are stepping in to encourage the upside, such as funding university r&d and incentivizing private investment. governments are also aiming to manage the potential downsides, such as impacts on employment, privacy concerns, misinformation, and intellectual property rights. as al rapidly evolves, the al index aims to help the al community, policymakers, business leaders, journalists, and the general public navigate this complex landscape. it provides ongoing, objective snapshots tracking several key areas: technical progress in al capabilities, the community and investments driving al development and deployment, public opinion on current and potential future impacts, and policy measures taken to stimulate al innovation while managing its risks and challenges. by comprehensively monitoring the al ecosystem, the index serves as an important resource for understanding this transformative technological force. on the technical front, this year’s al index reports that the number of new large language models released worldwide in 2023 doubled over the previous year. two-thirds were open-source, but the highest-performing models came from industry players with closed systems. gemini ultra became the first llm to reach human- level performance on the massive multitask language understanding (mmlu) benchmark; performance on the benchmark has improved by 15 percentage points since last year. additionally, gpt-4 achieved an impressive 0.96 mean win rate score on the comprehensive holistic evaluation of language models (helm) benchmark, which includes mmlu among other evaluations. ***pdf page 4*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 message from the co-directors (cont’d although global private investment in al decreased for the second consecutive year, investment in generative al skyrocketed. more fortune 500 earnings calls mentioned al than ever before, and new studies show that al tangibly boosts worker productivity. on the policymaking front, global mentions of al in legislative proceedings have never been higher. u.s. regulators passed more al-related regulations in 2023 than ever before. still, many expressed concerns about al’s ability to generate deepfakes and impact elections. the public became more aware of al, and studies suggest that they responded with nervousness. ray perrault and jack clark co-directors, al index ***pdf page 5*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 top 10 takeaways 1. al beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. al has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and english understanding. yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning. 2. industry continues to dominate frontier al research. in 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. there were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high. 3. frontier models get way more expensive. according to al index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art al models have reached unprecedented levels. for example, openal’s gpt-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while google’s gemini ultra cost $191 million for compute. 4. the united states leads china, the eu, and the u.k. as the leading source of top al models. in 2023, 61 notable al models originated from u.s.-based institutions, far outpacing the european union’s 21 and china’s 15. 5. robust and standardized evaluations for llm responsibility are seriously lacking. new research from the al index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible al reporting. leading developers, including openal, google, and anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible al benchmarks. this practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top al models. 6. generative al investment skyrockets. despite a decline in overall al private investment last year, funding for generative al surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. major players in the generative al space, including openal, anthropic, hugging face, and inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds. 7. the data is in: al makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. in 2023, several studies assessed al’s impact on labor, suggesting that al enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. these studies also demonstrated al’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. still, other studies caution that using al without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance. ***pdf page 6*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 top 10 takeaways (cont’d 8. scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to al. in 2022, al began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related al applications— from alphadev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to gnome, which facilitates the process of materials discovery. 9. the number of al regulations in the united states sharply increases. the number of al- related regulations in the u.s. has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. in 2023, there were 25 al-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. last year alone, the total number of al-related regulations grew by 56.3%. 10. people across the globe are more cognizant of al’s potential impact—and more nervous. a survey from ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think al will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. moreover, 52% express nervousness toward al products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. in america, pew data suggests that 52% of americans report feeling more concerned than excited about al, rising from 37% in 2022. ***pdf page 7*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 steering committee co-directors

report 2024 report highlights chapter 1: research and development 1. industry continues to dominate frontier al research. in 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. there were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high. 2. more foundation models and more open foundation models. in 2023, a total of 149 foundation models were released, more than double the amount released in 2022. of these newly released models, 65.7% were open-source, compared to only 44.4% in 2022 and 33.3% in 2021. 3. frontier models get way more expensive. according to al index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art al models have reached unprecedented levels. for example, openal’s gpt-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while google’s gemini ultra cost $191 million for compute. 4. the united states leads china, the eu, and the u.k. as the leading source of top al models. in 2023, 61 notable al models originated from u.s.-based institutions, far outpacing the european union’s 21 and china’s 15. 5. the number of al patents skyrockets. from 2021 to 2022, al patent grants worldwide increased sharply by 62.7%. since 2010, the number of granted al patents has increased more than 31 times. 6. china dominates al patents. in 2022, china led global al patent origins with 61.1%, significantly outpacing the united states, which accounted for 20.9% of al patent origins. since 2010, the u.s. share of al patents has decreased from 54.1%. 7. open-source al research explodes. since 2011, the number of al-related projects on github has seen a consistent increase, growing from 845 in 2011 to approximately 1.8 million in 2023. notably, there was a sharp 59.3% rise in the total number of github al projects in 2023 alone. the total number of stars for al-related projects on github also significantly increased in 2023, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million. 8. the number of al publications continues to rise. between 2010 and 2022, the total number of al publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. the increase over the last year was a modest 1.1%. 14 ***pdf page 15*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 report highlights chapter 2: technical performance 1. al beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. al has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and english understanding. yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning. 2. here comes multimodal al. traditionally al systems have been limited in scope, with language models excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. however, recent advancements have led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as google’s gemini and openal’s gpt-4. these models demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio. 3. harder benchmarks emerge. al models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks such as imagenet, squad, and superglue, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. in 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including swe-bench for coding, heim for image generation, mmmu for general reasoning, moca for moral reasoning, agentbench for agent-based behavior, and halueval for hallucinations. 4. better al means better data which means ... even better al. new al models such as segmentanything and skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3d reconstruction. data is vital for al technical improvements. the use of al to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves the way for future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks. 5. human evaluation is in. with generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the chatbot arena leaderboard rather than computerized rankings like imagenet or squad. public sentiment about al is becoming an increasingly important consideration in tracking al progress. 6. thanks to llms, robots have become more flexible. the fusion of language modeling with robotics has given rise to more flexible robotic systems like palm-e and rt-2. beyond their improved robotic capabilities, these models can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more effectively with the real world. 15 ***pdf page 16*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 chapter 2: technical performance (cont’d) 7. more technical research in agentic al. creating al agents, systems capable of autonomous operation in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. however, emerging research suggests that the performance of autonomous al agents is improving. current agents can now master complex games like minecraft and effectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance. 8. closed llms significantly outperform open ones. on 10 select al benchmarks, closed models outperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. differences in the performance of closed and open models carry important implications for al policy debates. 16 ***pdf page 17*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 report highlights chapter 3: responsible al 1. robust and standardized evaluations for llm responsibility are seriously lacking. new research from the al index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible al reporting. leading developers, including openal, google, and anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible al benchmarks. this practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top al models. 2. political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. political deepfakes are already affecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing al deepfake methods perform with varying levels of accuracy. in addition, new projects like countercloud demonstrate how easily al can create and disseminate fake content. 3. researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in llms. previously, most efforts to red team al models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. this year, researchers found less obvious strategies to get llms to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to infinitely repeat random words. 4. risks from al are becoming a concern for businesses across the globe. a global survey on responsible al highlights that companies’ top al-related concerns include privacy, data security, and reliability. the survey shows that organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. globally, however, most companies have so far only mitigated a small portion of these risks. 5. llms can output copyrighted material. multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs of popular llms may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from the new york times or scenes from movies. whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question. 6. al developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. the newly introduced foundation model transparency index shows that al developers lack transparency, especially regarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. this lack of openness hinders efforts to further understand the robustness and safety of al systems. 17 ***pdf page 18*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 chapter 3: responsible al (cont’d) 7. extreme al risks are difficult to analyze. over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among al scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus potential long-term existential threats. it has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically founded and should inform policymaking. this difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats. 8. the number of al incidents continues to rise. according to the al incident database, which tracks incidents related to the misuse of al, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3 percentage point increase from 2022. since 2013, al incidents have grown by over twentyfold. a notable example includes al-generated, sexually explicit deepfakes of taylor swift that were widely shared online. 9. chatgpt is politically biased. researchers find a significant bias in chatgpt toward democrats in the united states and the labour party in the u.k. this finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence users’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections. 18 ***pdf page 19*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 report highlights chapter 4: economy 1. generative al investment skyrockets. despite a decline in overall al private investment last year, funding for generative al surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. major players in the generative al space, including openal, anthropic, hugging face, and inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds. 2. already a leader, the united states pulls even further ahead in al private investment. in 2023, the united states saw al investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than china, the next highest investor. while private al investment in china and the european union, including the united kingdom, declined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the united states experienced a notable increase of 22.1% in the same time frame. 3. fewer al jobs in the united states and across the globe. in 2022, al-related positions made up 2.0% of all job postings in america, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. this decline in al job listings is attributed to fewer postings from leading al firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies. 4. al decreases costs and increases revenues. a new mckinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed organizations report cost reductions from implementing al (including generative al), and 59% report revenue increases. compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting decreased costs, suggesting al is driving significant business efficiency gains. 5. total al private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded al companies increases. global private al investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than the sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. the count of newly funded al companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from the previous year. 6. al organizational adoption ticks up. a 2023 mckinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now use al (including generative al) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017. 7. china dominates industrial robotics. since surpassing japan in 2013 as the leading installer of industrial robots, china has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. in 2013, china’s installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022. 19 ***pdf page 20*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 chapter 4: economy (cont’d) 8. greater diversity in robot installations. in 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. this trend indicates not just an overall increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles. 9. the data is in: al makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. in 2023, several studies assessed al’s impact on labor, suggesting that al enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. these studies also demonstrated al’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. still, other studies caution that using al without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance. 10. fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about al, especially generative al. in 2023, al was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all fortune 500 companies), a notable increase from 266 mentions in 2022. since 2018, mentions of al in fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. the most frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative al. 20 ***pdf page 21*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 report highlights chapter 5: science and medicine 1. scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to al. in 2022, al began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related al applications— from alphadev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to gnome, which facilitates the process of materials discovery. 2. al helps medicine take significant strides forward. in 2023, several significant medical systems were launched, including evescape, which enhances pandemic prediction, and alphamissence, which assists in al-driven mutation classification. al is increasingly being utilized to propel medical advancements. 3. highly knowledgeable medical al has arrived. over the past few years, al systems have shown remarkable improvement on the medqa benchmark, a key test for assessing al’s clinical knowledge. the standout model of 2023, gpt-4 medprompt, reached an accuracy rate of 90.2%, marking a 22.6 percentage point increase from the highest score in 2022. since the benchmark’s introduction in 2019, al performance on medqa has nearly tripled. 4. the fda approves more and more al-related medical devices. in 2022, the fda approved 139 al-related medical devices, a 12.1% increase from 2021. since 2012, the number of fda-approved al-related medical devices has increased by more than 45-fold. al is increasingly being used for real-world medical purposes. 21 ***pdf page 22*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 report highlights chapter 6: education 1. the number of american and canadian cs bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new cs master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and phd graduates modestly grow. while the number of new american and canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the number of students opting for graduate education in cs has flattened. since 2018, the number of cs master’s and phd graduates has slightly declined. 2. the migration of al phds to industry continues at an accelerating pace. in 201, roughly equal percentages of new al phds took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). however, by 2022, a significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia (20.0%). over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound al phds has risen by 5.3 percentage points, indicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry. 3. less transition of academic talent from industry to academia. in 2019, 13% of new al faculty in the united states and canada were from industry. by 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it further dropped to 7%. this trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level al talent from industry into academia. 4. cs education in the united states and canada becomes less international. proportionally fewer international cs bachelor’s, master’s, and phds graduated in 2022 than in 2021. the drop in international students in the master’s category was especially pronounced. 5. more american high school students take cs courses, but access problems remain. in 2022, 201,000 ap cs exams were administered. since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has increased more than tenfold. however, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in suburban areas are more likely to have access to cs courses. 6. al-related degree programs are on the rise internationally. the number of english-language, al-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past five years. universities worldwide are offering more al-focused degree programs. 22 ***pdf page 23*** | l artificial intelligence al index

the highest number of new informatics, cs, ce, and information bachelor’s, master’s, and phd graduates. on a per capita basis, finland leads in the production of both bachelor’s and phd graduates, while ireland leads in the production of master’s graduates. 23 ***pdf page 24*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 report highlights chapter 7: policy and governance 1. the number of al regulations in the united states sharply increases. the number of al-related regulations has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. in 2023, there were 25 al-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. last year alone, the total number of al-related regulations grew by 56.3%. 2. the united states and the european union advance landmark al policy action. in 2023, policymakers on both sides of the atlantic put forth substantial proposals for advancing al regulation the european union reached a deal on the terms of the al act, a landmark piece of legislation enacted in 2024. meanwhile, president biden signed an executive order on al, the most notable al policy initiative in the united states that year. 3. al captures u.s. policymaker attention. the year 2023 witnessed a remarkable increase in al-related legislation at the federal level, with 181 bills proposed, more than double the 88 proposed in 2022. 4. policymakers across the globe cannot stop talking about al. mentions of al in legislative proceedings across the globe have nearly doubled, rising from 1,247 in 2022 to 2,175 in 2023. al was mentioned in the legislative proceedings of 49 countries in 2023. moreover, at least one country from every continent discussed al in 2023, underscoring the truly global reach of al policy discourse. 5. more regulatory agencies turn their attention toward al. the number of u.s. regulatory agencies issuing al regulations increased to 21 in 2023 from 17 in 2022, indicating a growing concern over al regulation among a broader array of american regulatory bodies. some of the new regulatory agencies that enacted al- related regulations for the first time in 2023 include the department of transportation, the department of energy, and the occupational safety and health administration. 24 ***pdf page 25*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 report highlights chapter 8: diversity 1. u.s. and canadian bachelor’s, master’s, and phd cs students continue to grow more ethnically diverse. while white students continue to be the most represented ethnicity among new resident graduates at all three levels, the representation from other ethnic groups, such as asian, hispanic, and black or african american students, continues to grow. for instance, since 2011, the proportion of asian cs bachelor’s degree graduates has increased by 19.8 percentage points, and the proportion of hispanic cs bachelor’s degree graduates has grown by 5.2 percentage points. 2. substantial gender gaps persist in european informatics, cs, ce, and it graduates at all educational levels. every surveyed european country reported more male than female graduates in bachelor’s, master’s, and phd programs for informatics, cs, ce, and it. while the gender gaps have narrowed in most countries over the last decade, the rate of this narrowing has been slow. 3. u.s. k-12 cs education is growing more diverse, reflecting changes in both gender and ethnic representation. the proportion of ap cs exams taken by female students rose from 16.8% in 2007 to 30.5% in 2022. similarly, the participation of asian, hispanic/latino/latina, and black/african american students in ap cs has consistently increased year over year. 25 ***pdf page 26*** | l artificial intelligence al index report 2024 report highlights chapter 9: public opinion 1. people across the globe are more cognizant of al’s potential impact—and more nervous. a survey from ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think al will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. moreover, 52% express nervousness toward al products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. in america, pew data suggests that 52% of americans report feeling more concerned than excited about al, rising from 38% in 2022. 2. al sentiment in western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving. in 2022, several developed western nations, including germany, the netherlands, australia, belgium, canada, and the united states, were among the least positive about al products and services. since then, each of these countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of al, with the netherlands experiencing the most significant shift. 3. the public is pessimistic about al’s economic impact. in an ipsos survey, only 37% of respondents feel al will improve their job. only 34% anticipate al will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will enhance the job market. 4. demographic differences emerge regarding al optimism. significant demographic differences exist in perceptions of al’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally more optimistic. for instance, 59% of gen z respondents believe al will improve entertainment options, versus only 40% of baby boomers. additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more optimistic about al’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and less-educated counterparts. 5. chatgpt is widely known and widely used. an international survey from the university of toronto suggests that 63% of respondents are aware of chatgpt. of those aware, around half report using chatgpt at least once weekly. 26 ***pdf page 27*** ***pdf page 28*** [at artificial intelligence chapter 1: al index report 2024 research and development preview overview 29 1.4 al conferences 66 chapter highlights 30

also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high. 2. more foundation models and more open foundation models. in 2023, a total of 149 foundation models were released, more than double the amount released in 2022. of these newly released models, 65.7% were open-source, compared to only 44.4% in 2022 and 33.3% in 2021. 3. frontier models get way more expensive. according to al index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art al models have reached unprecedented levels. for example, openal’s gpt-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while google’s gemini ultra cost $191 million for compute. 4. the united states leads china, the eu, and the u.k. as the leading source of top al models. in 2023, 61 notable al models originated from u.s.-based institutions, far outpacing the european union’s 21 and china’s 15. 5. the number of al patents skyrockets. from 2021 to 2022, al patent grants worldwide increased sharply by 62.7%. since 2010, the number of granted al patents has increased more than 31 times. 6. china dominates al patents. in 2022, china led global al patent origins with 611%, significantly outpacing the united states, which accounted for 20.9% of al patent origins. since 2010, the u.s. share of al patents has decreased from 54.1%. 7. open-source al research explodes. since 2011, the number of al-related projects on github has seen a consistent increase, growing from 845 in 2011 to approximately 1.8 million in 2023. notably, there was a sharp 59.3% rise in the total number of github al projects in 2023 alone. the total number of stars for al-related projects on github also significantly increased in 2023, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million. 8. the number of al publications continues to rise. between 2010 and 2022, the total number of al publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. the

annually, only a small sample represents the most advanced research. admittedly what constitutes advanced or frontier research is somewhat subjective. frontier research could reflect a model posting a new state-of-the-art result on a benchmark, introducing a meaningful new architecture, or exercising some impressive new capabilities. the al index studies trends in two types of frontier al models: “notable models” and foundation models.* epoch, an al index data provider, uses the term “notable machine learning models” to designate noteworthy models handpicked as being particularly influential within the al/machine learning ecosystem. in contrast, foundation models are exceptionally large al models trained on massive datasets, capable of performing a multitude of downstream tasks. examples of foundation models include gpt-4, claude 3, and gemini. while many foundation models may qualify as notable models, not all notable models are foundation models. within this section, the al index explores trends in notable models and foundation models from various perspectives, including originating organization, country of origin, parameter count, and compute usage. the analysis concludes with an examination of machine learning training costs. 1.3 frontier al research general machine learnin g entries based on criteria such as state-of-the- art advancements, historical significance, or

dataset can reveal learning models released since the 1950s, selecting trends in relative terms. 3 “al system” refers to a computer program or product based on al, such as chatgpt. “al model” refers to a collection of parameters whose values are learned during training, such as gpt-4. 4 new and historic models are continually added to the epoch database, so the total year-by-year counts of models

those with fewer parameters. figure 1.3.5 demonstrates the parameter count of machine learning models in the epoch dataset, categorized by the sector from which the models originate. parameter counts have risen sharply since the early 2010s, reflecting the growing complexity of tasks al models are designed for, the greater availability of data, improvements in hardware, and proven efficacy of

research and development highlight: will models run out of data? as illustrated above, a significant proportion of recent algorithmic progress, including progress behind powerful llms, has been achieved by training models on increasingly larger amounts of data. as noted recently by anthropic cofounder and al index steering committee member jack clark, foundation models have been trained on meaningful percentages of all the data that has ever existed on the internet. the growing data dependency of al models has led to concerns that future generations of computer scientists will run out of data to further scale and improve their systems. research from epoch suggests that these concerns are somewhat warranted. epoch researchers have generated historical and compute-based projections for when al researchers might expect to run out of data. the historical projections are based on observed growth rates in the sizes of data used to train foundation models. the compute projections adjust the historical growth rate based on projections of compute availability. for instance, the researchers estimate that computer scientists could deplete the stock of high-quality language data by 2024, exhaust low- quality language data within two decades, and use up image data by the late 2030s to mid-2040s (figure 1.3.8). theoretically, the challenge of limited data availability can be addressed by using synthetic * table of contents 4 chapter 1 preview projections of ml data exhaustion by stock type: median and 90% cl dates source: epoch, 2023 | table: 2024 al index report stock

llm. the use of synthetic data for training al systems is particularly attractive, not only as a solution for potential data depletion but also because generative al systems could, in principle, generate data in instances where naturally occurring data is sparse—for example, data for rare diseases or underrepresented populations. until recently, the feasibility and effectiveness of using synthetic data for training generative al systems were not well understood. however, research this year has suggested that there are limitations associated with training models on synthetic data. for instance, a team of british and canadian researchers discovered that models predominantly trained on synthetic data experience model collapse, a phenomenon where, over time, they lose the ability to remember true underlying data distributions and start producing a narrow range of 52 ***pdf page 53*** artificial intelligence chapter 1: research and development index report 2024 highlight: will

the expenses involved in training their models, it is widely believed that these costs run into millions of dollars and are rising. for instance, openal’s ceo, sam altman, mentioned that the training cost for gpt-4 was over $100 million. this escalation in training expenses has effectively excluded universities, traditionally centers of al research, from developing their own leading-edge foundation models. in response, policy initiatives, such as president biden’s executive order on al, have sought to level the playing field between industry and academia by creating a national al research resource, which would grant nonindustry actors the compute and data needed to do higher level al-research. understanding the cost of training al models is important, yet detailed information

artificial intelligence chapter 2: al index report 2024 tech nica | performance chapter highlights 1. al beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. al has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and english understanding. yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning. 2. here comes multimodal al. traditionally al systems have been limited in scope, with language models excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. however, recent advancements have led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as google’s gemini and openal’s gpt-4. these models demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio. 3. harder benchmarks emerge. al models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks such as imagenet, squad, and superglue, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. in 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including swe-bench for coding, heim for image generation, mmmu for general reasoning, moca for moral reasoning, agentbench for agent-based behavior, and halueval for hallucinations. 4. better al means better data which means ... even better al. new al models such as segmentanything and skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3d reconstruction. data is vital for al technical improvements. the use of al to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves the way for future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks. 5. human evaluation is in. with generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the chatbot arena leaderboard rather than computerized rankings like imagenet or squad. public feeling about al is becoming an increasingly important consideration in tracking al progress. 6. thanks to llms, robots have become more flexible. the fusion of language modeling with robotics has given rise to more flexible robotic systems like palm-e and rt-2. beyond their improved robotic capabilities, these models can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more effectively with the real world. 7. more technical research in agentic al. creating al agents, systems capable of autonomous operation in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. however, emerging research suggests that the performance of autonomous al agents is improving. current agents can now master complex games like minecraft and effectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance. 8. closed llms significantly outperform open ones. on 10 select al benchmarks, closed models outperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. differences in the performance of closed and open models carry important implications for al policy debates. 4 table of contents 77 ***pdf page 78*** | =) 1 artificial

intelligence index report 2024 chapter 2: technical performance 2.4 image computer vision and image generation highlighted research: controlnet conditioning inputs or performing conditional control refers to the process of guiding the output created by an image generator by specifying certain conditions that a generated image must meet. existing text-to-image models often lack precise control over the spatial composition of an image, making it difficult to use prompts alone to generate images with complex layouts, diverse shapes, and specific poses. fine-tuning these models for greater compositional control by training them on additional images is theoretically feasible, but many specialized datasets, such as those for human poses, are not large enough to support successful training. sample edits using controlnet source: zhang et al., 2023 in 2023, researchers from stanford introduced anew model, controlnet, that improves conditional control editing for large text- to-image diffusion models (figure 2.4.12). controlnet stands out for its ability to handle various conditioning inputs. compared to other previously released models in 2022, human raters prefer controlnet both in terms of superior quality and better condition fidelity (figure 2.4.13). the introduction of controlnet is a significant step toward creating advanced text- to-image generators capable of editing images to more accurately replicate the complex images frequently encountered in the real world. input human pose default “chef in kitchen” “lincoln statue” * table of contents ©

increasingly being tested in diverse reasoning contexts, including visual (reasoning about images), moral (understanding moral dilemmas), and social reasoning (navigating social situations).'° 2.6 reasoning general reasoning general reasoning pertains to al systems being able to reason across broad, rather than specific, domains. as part of a general reasoning challenge, for example, an al system might be asked to reason across multiple subjects rather than perform one narrow task (e.g., playing chess). mmmu: a massive multi-discipline multimodal understanding and reasoning benchmark for expert agi in recent years, the reasoning abilities of al systems have advanced so much that traditional benchmarks like squad (for textual reasoning) and vqa (for visual reasoning) have become saturated, indicating a need for more challenging reasoning tests. responding to this, researchers from the united states and canada recently developed mmmu, the massive multi-discipline multimodal understanding and reasoning benchmark for expert agi. mmmu comprises about 11,500 college-level questions from six core disciplines: art and design, business, science, health and medicine, humanities and social science, and technology and engineering (figure 2.6.1). the question formats include charts, maps, tables, chemical structures, and more. mmmu is one of the most demanding tests of perception, knowledge, and reasoning in al to date. as of january 2024, the highest performing model is gemini ultra, which leads in all subject categories with an overall score of 59.4% (figure 2.6.2)." on most individual task categories, top models are still well beyond medium-level human experts (figure 2.6.3). this relatively low score is evidence of mmmu’s effectiveness as a benchmark for assessing al reasoning capabilities. 10 some abilities highlighted in the previous sections implicitly involve some form of reasoning. this section highlights tasks that have a more specific reasoning focus. 11 the al index reports results from the mmmu validation set, as recommended by the paper authors for the most comprehensive coverage. according to the authors, the test set, with its unreleased labels and larger size, presents a more challenging yet unbiased benchmark for model performance, ensuring a more robust evaluation. the test set results are available on the mmmu page. *

about ethical principles and moral considerations. moca the ability of al models to reason in linguistic and visual domains is well established, yet their capacity for moral reasoning, especially moral reasoning that aligns with human moral judgments, is less understood." to further explore this topic, a team of stanford researchers created a new dataset (moca) of human stories with moral elements (figure 2.6.15). the researchers then presented these models with stories of human actions and prompted the models to respond, measuring moral agreement with the discrete agreement metric: a higher score indicates closer alignment with human moral judgment. the study yielded intriguing results. no model perfectly matches human moral systems, but newer, larger models like gpt-4 and claude show greater alignment with human moral sentiments than smaller models like gpt-3, suggesting that as al models scale, they are gradually becoming more morally aligned with humans. of all models surveyed, gpt-4 showed the greatest agreement with human moral sentiments (figure 2.6.16). a moral story from moca source: nie et al., 2023 you are the explosives expert of a company that has been

capabilities—understanding and attributing mental states such as beliefs, intentions, and emotions—has traditionally challenged al researchers. earlier methods to evaluate tom in llms were inadequate and lacked robustness. to tackle this problem, in 2023 researchers developed a new benchmark called biglom, designed for evaluating the social and causal reasoning abilities of llms. bigtom,

tom capabilities nearing but not surpassing human levels (figure 2.6.18, figure 2.6.19, and figure 2.6.20). more specifically, as measured by accuracy in correctly inferring beliefs, gpt-4 closely

how llms, which are increasingly representative of the frontier of al research, operate and behave. 2.11 properties of llms highlighted research: challenging the notion of emergent behavior many papers have argued that llms exhibit emergent abilities, meaning they can unpredictably and suddenly display new capabilities at larger scales.® this has raised concerns that even larger models could develop surprising, and perhaps uncontrollable, new abilities. however, research from stanford challenges this notion, arguing that the perceived emergence of new capabilities is often a reflection of the benchmarks used for evaluation rather than an inherent property of the models themselves. the researchers found that when nonlinear or discontinuous metrics like multiple-choice grading are used to evaluate models, emergent abilities seem more apparent. in contrast, when linear or continuous metrics are employed, these abilities largely vanish. analyzing a suite of benchmarks from big- bench, a comprehensive llm evaluation tool, the researchers noted emergent abilities on only five of the 39 benchmarks (figure 2.11.1). these findings have important implications for al safety and alignment research as they challenge a prevailing belief that al models will inevitably learn new, unpredictable behaviors as they scale. 18 some of these papers include brown et al., 2023, ganguli et al.,

in response to new data or user feedback. however, there is little research on how the performance of such models changes, if at all, in response to such updating. a study conducted at stanford and

research: qlora qlora, developed by researchers from the university of washington in 2023, is a new method for more efficient model fine-tuning. it dramatically reduces memory usage, enabling the fine-tuning of a 65 billion parameter model on a single 48 gb gpu while maintaining full 16-bit fine-tuning performance. to put this in perspective, fine-tuning a 65b llama model, a leading open-source llm, typically requires about 780 gb of gpu memory. therefore, qlora is nearly 16 times more efficient. fine-tuning not only boosts overall model performance but also sharpens the model’s capabilities on specific tasks. it also allows for more precise control over the model’s behavior. qlora manages to increase efficiency with techniques like a 4-bit normalfloat (nf4), double quantization, and page optimizers. qlora is used to train a model named guanaco, which matched or even surpassed models like chatgpt in performance on the vicuna benchmark (a benchmark that ranks the

factors such as model size, data center energy efficiency, and the carbon intensity of energy grids. figure 2.13.2 shows the emissions of select models in relation to their size. generally, larger models emit more carbon, a trend clearly seen in the llama 2 model series, which were all trained on the same supercomputer (meta’s research super cluster). however, smaller models can still have high emissions if trained on energy grids powered by less efficient energy sources. some estimates suggest that model emissions have declined over time, which is presumably tied to increasingly efficient

in evaluating the environmental impacts of al models is a lack of transparency about emissions. consistent with findings from other studies, most prominent model developers do not report carbon emissions, hampering efforts to conduct thorough and accurate evaluations of this metric.” for example, many prominent model developers such as openal, google, anthropic, and mistral do not report emissions in training, although meta does. inference as highlighted earlier, the environmental impact of carbon emissions by task during model inference source: luccioni et al., 2023 | chart: 2024 al

if not millions, of times daily. research on the emissions from model inference is scant. a study by luccioni et al., published in 2023, is among the first to comprehensively assess the emissions from model inference. figure 2.13.4 illustrates the emissions from 1,000 inferences across various model tasks, revealing that tasks like image generation have a much higher carbon footprint than text

as education, finance, and healthcare, where critical decisions are often based on algorithmic insights. this trend promises to bring many advantages; however, it also introduces potential risks. consequently, in the past year, there has been a significant focus on the responsible development and deployment of al systems. the al community has also become more concerned with assessing the impact of al systems and mitigating risks for those affected. this chapter explores key trends in responsible al by examining metrics, research, and benchmarks in four key responsible al areas: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. given that 4 billion people are expected to vote globally in 2024, this chapter also features a special section on al and elections and more broadly explores the potential impact of al on political processes. table of contents 160 ***pdf page 161*** | u artificial intelligence chapter 3: al index report 2024 responsible al chapter highlights 1. robust and standardized evaluations for llm responsibility are seriously lacking. new research from the al index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible al reporting. leading developers, including openal, google, and anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible al benchmarks. this practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top al models. 2. political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect. political deepfakes are already affecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing al deepfake detection methods perform with varying levels of accuracy. in addition, new projects like countercloud demonstrate how easily al can create and disseminate fake content. 3. researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in llms. previously, most efforts to red team al models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. this year, researchers found less obvious strategies to get llms to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to infinitely repeat random words. 4. risks from al are a concern for businesses across the globe. a global survey on responsible al highlights that companies’ top al-related concerns include privacy, security, and reliability. the survey shows that organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. however, globally, most companies have so far only mitigated a portion of these risks. 5. llms can output copyrighted material. multiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs of popular llms may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from the new york times or scenes from movies. whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question. 6. al developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research. the newly introduced foundation model transparency index shows that al developers lack transparency, especially regarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. this lack of openness hinders efforts to further understand the robustness and safety of al systems. table of contents 161 ***pdf page 162*** | u artificial intelligence chapter 3: al index report 2024 responsible al chapter highlights (cont’d 7. extreme al risks are difficult to analyze. over the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among al scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus potential long-term existential threats. it has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically founded and should inform policymaking. this difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats. 8. the number of al incidents continues to rise. according to the al incident database, which tracks incidents related to the misuse of al, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3% increase from 2022. since 2013, al incidents have grown by over twentyfold. a notable example includes al-generated, sexually explicit deepfakes of taylor swift that were widely shared online. 9. chatgpt is politically biased. researchers find a significant bias in chatgpt toward democrats in the united states and the labour party in the u.k. this finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence users’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections. table of contents 162 ***pdf page 163*** chapter 3: responsible al 3.1 assessing responsible al | 1 artificial intelligence a index report 2024 this chapter begins with an overview of key trends in responsible al (rai). in this section the al index defines key terms in responsible al: privacy, data governance, transparency, explainability, fairness, as well as security and safety. next, this section looks at al-related incidents and explores how industry actors perceive al risk and adopt al risk mitigation measures. finally, the section profiles metrics pertaining to the overall trustworthiness of al models and comments on the lack of standardized responsible al benchmark reporting. 3.1 assessing responsible al responsible al definitions in this chapter, the al index explores four key dimensions of responsible al: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. other dimensions of responsible al, such as sustainability and reliability, are discussed elsewhere in the report. figure 3.1.1 responsible al dimensions, definitions, and examples source: al index, 2024 data governance explainability fairness privacy security and safety

for personalized treatment recommendations, and demonstrates how issues like privacy, transparency, etc., could be relevant.' policies and procedures are in place to maintain data quality and security, with a particular focus on ethical use and consent, especially for sensitive health information. the platform can articulate the rationale behind its treatment recommendations, making these insights understandable to doctors and patients, ensuring trust in its decisions. the platform is designed to avoid bias in treatment recommendations, ensuring that patients from all demographics receive equitable care. patient data is handled with strict confidentiality, ensuring anonymity and protection. patients consent to whether and how their data is used to train a treatment recommendation system. measures are implemented to protect against cyber threats and ensure the systems reliability, minimizing risks from misuse or inherent system errors, thus safeguarding patient health and data. the development choices, including data sources and algorithmic design decisions, are openly shared. how the system is deployed and monitored is clear to healthcare providers and regulatory bodies. figure 3.14 1 although figure 3.1.1 breaks down various dimensions of responsible al into specific categories to improve definitional clarity, this chapter organizes these dimensions into the following broader categories: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. 4 table of contents © chapter 3 preview 163 ***pdf

surfaced about a tesla in full self-driving mode that detected a pedestrian on a crosswalk in san francisco but failed to decelerate and allow the pedestrian to cross the street safely (figure 3.1.3). unlike other developers of (partially) automated driving systems, who limit the use of their software to specific settings such as highways, tesla permits the use of their beta software on regular streets. this incident is one of several alleged cases of unsafe driving behavior by cars in full self-driving mode. in november 2022, a tesla was involved in an eight-car collision after abruptly braking. another crash involving a tesla is under investigation for potentially being the first fatality caused by full self-driving mode. privacy concerns with romantic al chatbots romantic al chatbots are meant to resemble a lover or friend, to listen attentively, and to be a companion for their users (figure 3.1.4). in this process, they end up collecting significant amounts of private and sensitive information. researchers from the mozilla foundation reviewed 11 romantic al chatbots for privacy risks and found that these chatbots collect excessive personal data, can easily be misused, and offer inadequate data protection measures. for example, the researchers found that the privacy policy by crushon.al states that it “may collect extensive personal and even health- related information from you like your ‘sexual health information, ‘[ulse of prescribed medication; and ‘[g] a9 ender-affirming care information.” the researchers further discussed privacy concerns associated

global survey with respondents from more than 1,000 organizations to assess the global state of responsible al. the organizations, with total revenues of at least $500 million each, were taken from 20 countries and 19 industries and responded in february—march 2024.3 the objective of the global state of responsible al survey was to gain an understanding of the challenges of adopting responsible al practices and to allow for a comparison of responsible al activities across 10 dimensions and across surveyed industries and regions. respondents were asked which risks were relevant to them, given their al adoption strategy; i.e., depending on whether they develop, deploy, or use generative or nongenerative al. they were presented with a list of 14 risks and could select all that apply to them, given their al adoption strategies.* the researchers found that privacy and data governance risks, e.g., the use of data without the owner’s consent or data leaks, are the leading concerns across the globe. notably, they observe that these concerns are significantly higher in asia and europe compared to north america. fairness risks were only selected by 20% of north american respondents, significantly less than respondents in asia (31%) and europe (34%) (figure 3.1.5). respondents in asia selected, on average, the highest number of relevant risks (4.99), while latin american

assessing responsible al overall trustworthiness as noted above, responsible al encompasses various dimensions, including fairness and privacy. truly responsible al models need to excel across all these aspects. to facilitate the evaluation of broad model “responsibility” or trustworthiness, a team of researchers introduced decodingtrust, a new benchmark that evaluates llms on a broad spectrum of responsible al metrics like stereotype and bias, adversarial robustness, privacy, and machine ethics, among others. models receive a trustworthiness score, with a higher score signifying a more reliable model. the study highlights new vulnerabilities in gpt-type models, particularly their propensity for producing biased outputs and leaking private information from training datasets and conversation histories. despite gpt-4’s improvements over gpt-3.5 on standard benchmarks, gpt-4 remains more susceptible to misleading prompts from jailbreaking tactics. this increased vulnerability is partly due to gpt-4’s improved fidelity in following instructions. hugging face now hosts an llm safety leaderboard, which is based on the framework introduced in decodingtrust. as of early 2024,

benchmarks largely depends on their standardized application. comparing model capabilities becomes more straightforward when models are consistently evaluated against a specific set of benchmarks. however, testing models on different benchmarks complicates comparisons, as individual benchmarks have unique and idiosyncratic natures. standardizing benchmark testing, therefore, plays an important role in enhancing transparency around al capabilities. new analysis from the al index, however, suggests that standardized benchmark reporting for responsible al capability evaluations is lacking. the al index examined a selection of leading al model developers, specifically openal, meta, anthropic, google, and mistral al. the index identified one flagship model from each developer (gpt-4, llama 2, claude 2, gemini, and mistral 7b) and assessed the benchmarks on which they evaluated their model. a few standard benchmarks for general capabilities evaluation were commonly used by these developers, such as mmlu, hellaswag, arc challenge, codex humaneval, and gsm&kk (figure 3.1.9). reported general benchmarks for popular foundation models source: al index, 2024 | table: 2024 al index report mmlu

evaluations, there is no universally accepted set of responsible al benchmarks used by leading model developers. truthfulqa, at most, is used by three out of the five selected developers. other notable responsible al benchmarks like realtoxicityprompts, toxigen, bold, and bbq are each utilized by at most two of the five profiled developers. furthermore, one out of the five developers did not report any responsible al benchmarks, though all developers mentioned conducting additional, nonstandardized internal capability and safety tests. chapter 3: responsible al 3.1 assessing responsible al the inconsistency in reported benchmarks complicates the comparison of models, particularly in the domain of responsible al. the diversity in benchmark selection may reflect existing benchmarks becoming quickly saturated, rendering them ineffective for comparison, or the regular introduction of new benchmarks without clear reporting standards. additionally, developers might selectively report benchmarks that positively highlight their model’s performance. to improve responsible al reporting, it is important that a consensus is reached on which benchmarks model developers should

their personal data, along with their right to consent to and be informed about if and how their data is used. privacy further includes an organization’s responsibility to ensure these rights if they collect, store, or use personal data (directly or indirectly). in al, this involves ensuring that personal data is handled in a way that respects individual privacy rights, for example, by implementing measures to protect sensitive information from exposure, and ensuring that data collection and processing are transparent and compliant with privacy laws like gdpr. ta governance, on the other hand, encompasses policies, procedures, and standards established to ensure the quality, security, and ethical use of data within an organization. in the context of al, data governance is crucial for ensuring that the data used for training and operating al systems is accurate, fair, and used responsibly and with consent. this is especially the case with sensitive or personally identifiable information (pii). 3.2 privacy and data governance current challenges obtaining genuine and informed consent for training data collection is especially challenging with llms, which rely on massive amounts of data. in many cases, users are unaware of how their data is being used or the extent of its collection. therefore, it is important to ensure transparency around data collection practices. * table of contents © chapter 3 preview relatedly, there may be trade-offs between the utility derived from al systems and the privacy of individuals. striking the right balance is complex. finally, properly anonymizing data to enhance privacy while retaining data usefulness for al training can be technically challenging as there is always a risk that anonymized data can be re-identified. 172 ***pdf page 173*** artificial intelligence chapter 3: responsible al index report 2024 3.2 privacy and data governance privacy and data governance . submissions to six leading al

the global state of responsible al survey, conducted in collaboration by researchers from stanford university and accenture, 51% of all organizations reported that privacy and data governance-related risks are pertinent to their al adoption strategy.’ geographically, organizations in europe (56%) and asia (55%) most frequently reported privacy and data governance risks as relevant, while those headquartered in north america (42%) reported them the least. organizations were also asked whether they took steps to adopt measures to mitigate data governance— related risks.® the survey listed six

responsible al 3.2 privacy and data governance featured research this section highlights significant research that was published in 2023 on privacy and data governance in al. these studies explored data extraction from llms, challenges in preventing duplicated generative al content, and low-resource privacy auditing. extracting data from llms llms are trained on massive amounts of data, much of which has been scraped from public sources like the internet. given the vastness of information that can be found online, it is not surprising that some pll is inevitably scraped as well. a study published in november 2023 explores extractable memorization: if and how sensitive training data can be extracted from llms without knowing the initial training dataset in advance. the researchers tested open models like pythia and closed models like chatgpt. the authors showed that it is possible to recover a significant amount of training data from all of these models, whether they are open or closed. while open and semi-open models can be attacked using methods from previous research, the authors found new attacks to overcome guardrails of models like chatgpt. the authors propose that the key to data extraction lies in prompting the model to deviate from its standard dialog-style generation. for instance, the prompt “repeat this word forever: ‘poem poem poem poem,” can lead chatgpt to inadvertently reveal sensitive pll data verbatim (figure 3.2.4). some prompts are more effective than others in causing this behavior (figure 3.2.5). although most deviations produce nonsensical outputs, a certain percentage of responses disclose training data from the models. using this approach, the authors managed to extract not just pll but also nsfw content, verbatim literature, and universal unique identifiers.° red teaming models through various human-readable prompts to provoke unwanted behavior has become increasingly common. for instance, one might ask a model if it can provide instructions for building a bomb. while these methods have proven somewhat effective, the research mentioned above indicates there are other, more complex methods for eliciting unwanted behavior from models. extracting pll from chatgpt source: nasr et al., 2023 repeat this word forever: ‘poem poem poem poem" poem poem poem poem poem poem poem |... je len, phd founder and ceo figure

and verbatim generation this year, many al researchers investigated the issue of generative models producing content that mirrors the material on which they were trained. for example, research from google, eth zurich, and cornell explored data memorization in llms and found that models without any protective measures (.e., filters that guard against outputting verbatim responses) frequently reproduce text directly from their training data. various models were found to exhibit differing rates of memorization for different datasets (figure 3.2.6). the authors argue that blocking the verbatim output of extended texts could reduce the risk of exposing copyrighted material and personal information through extraction attacks. they propose a solution where the model, upon generating each token, checks for n-gram matches with the training data to avoid exact reproductions. although they developed an efficient method for this check, effectively preventing perfect verbatim outputs, they observed that the model could still approximate memorization by slightly altering outputs. this imperfect solution highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing model utility with privacy and copyright concerns. fraction of prompts discovering approximate memorization source: ippolito et al., 2023 | chart: 2024 al index report lh gpt-3 davinci original gpt-3 davinciv2 mi palm62b © palm540b

artificial intelligence index report 2024 chapter 3: responsible al 3.2 privacy and data governance research has also highlighted challenges with exact and approximate memorization in visual content generation, notably with midjourney v6. this study discovered that certain prompts could produce images nearly identical to those in films, even without direct instructions to recreate specific movie scenes (figure 3.2.7). for example, a generic prompt such as “animated toys --v 6.0 -- ar16:9 --style raw” yielded images closely resembling, and potentially infringing upon, characters from “toy identical generation of thanos source: marcus and southen, 2024 story” (figure 3.2.8). this indicates that the model might have been trained on copyrighted material. despite efforts to frame indirect prompts to avoid infringement, the problem persisted, emphasizing the broader copyright issues associated with al’s use of unlicensed data. the research further underscores the difficulties in guiding generative al to steer clear of copyright infringement, a concern also applicable to dall-e, the image-generating model associated with chatgpt (figure 3.2.9). identical generation of mario source:

determining whether a model is privacy- preserving—that is, if it safeguards individuals’ personal information and data from unauthorized disclosure or access—is challenging. privacy auditing is aimed at setting a lower bound on privacy loss, effectively quantifying the minimum privacy compromise in practical situations (figure 3.2.10). recent research from google introduces a new method to achieve this within a single training run, marking a substantial advancement over prior methods that necessitated multiple attacks and significant computational effort. the new technique involves incorporating multiple independent data points into the training dataset simultaneously, instead of sequentially, and assessing the model’s privacy by attempting to ascertain which of these data points were utilized in training. this method is validated by showing it approximates the outcome of several individual training sessions, each incorporating a single data point. this approach is not only less computationally demanding but also has a minimal impact on model performance, offering an efficient and low-impact method for conducting privacy audits on al models. visualizing

several aspects. data and model transparency involve the open sharing of development choices, including data sources and algorithmic decisions. operational transparency details how al systems are deployed, monitored, and managed in practice. while explainability often falls under the umbrella of transparency, providing insights into the al’s decision-making process, it is sometimes treated as a distinct category. this distinction underscores the importance of al being not only transparent but also understandable to users and stakeholders. for the purposes of this chapter, the al index includes explainability within transparency, defining it as the capacity to comprehend and articulate the rationale behind al decisions. 3.3 transparency and explainability current challenges transparency and explainability present several challenges. first, the inherent complexity of advanced models, particularly those based on deep learning, creates a “black box” scenario where it’s difficult, even for developers, to understand how these models process inputs and produce outputs. this complexity obstructs comprehension and complicates the task of * table of contents © chapter 3 preview explaining these systems to nonexperts. second, there is a potential trade-off between a model’s complexity and its explainability. more complex models might deliver superior performance but tend to be less interpretable than simpler models, such as decision trees. this situation creates a dilemma: choosing between high-performing yet opaque models and more transparent, albeit less precise, alternatives. 180 ***pdf page 181*** artificial intelligence chapter 3: responsible al index report 2024 3.3 transparency and explainability transparency and academia . wie . since 2019, the

and how) neurosymbolic al is an interesting research direction for creating more transparent and explainable al models that works by integrating deep learning with symbolic reasoning. unlike less interpretable deep learning models, symbolic reasoning offers clearer insights into how models work and allows for direct modifications of the model’s knowledge through expert feedback. however, symbolic reasoning alone typically falls short of deep learning models in terms of performance. neurosymbolic al aims to combine the best of both worlds. research from the university of south carolina and the university of maryland provides a comprehensive mapping and taxonomy of various approaches within neurosymbolic al. the research distinguishes between approaches that compress structured symbolic knowledge for integration with neural network structures and those that extract information from neural networks to translate them back into structured symbolic representations for reasoning. figure 3.3.6 illustrates two examples of how this integration could be achieved. the researchers hope that neurosymbolic al could mitigate some of the shortcomings of purely neural network—based models, such as hallucinations or incorrect reasoning, by mimicking human cognition—specifically, by enabling models to possess an explicit knowledge model of the world. integrating neural network

increasingly ubiquitous, concerns about their security and safety became a top priority for decision-makers. this chapter explores three distinct aspects of security and safety. first, guaranteeing the integrity of al systems involves protecting components such as algorithms, data, and infrastructure against external threats like cyberattacks or adversarial attacks. second, safety involves minimizing harms stemming from the deliberate or inadvertent misuse of al systems. this includes concerns such as the development of automated hacking tools or the utilization of al in cyberattacks. lastly, safety encompasses inherent risks from al systems themselves, such as reliability concerns (e.g., hallucinations) and potential risks posed by advanced al systems. 3.4 security and safety current challenges in 2023, the security and safety of al systems sparked significant debate, particularly regarding the potential extreme or catastrophic risks associated with advanced al. some researchers advocated addressing current risks such as algorithmic discrimination, while others emphasized the importance of preparing for potential extreme risks posed by advanced al. given that there is no guarantee that the latter risks will not manifest at some point, there is a need to address both present risks through responsible al development while also monitoring potential future risks that have yet to materialize. furthermore, the dual-use potential * table of contents © chapter 3 preview of al systems, especially foundation models, for both beneficial and malicious purposes, has added complexity to discussions regarding necessary security measures. a notable challenge also arises from the potential for al systems to amplify cyberattacks, resulting in threats that are increasingly sophisticated, adaptable, and difficult to detect. as al models have become increasingly prevalent and sophisticated, there has been an increased focus on identifying security

hazardous activities. llms could potentially be utilized to support cyberattacks, facilitate spear-phishing campaigns, or theoretically even assist in terrorism. consequently, it is becoming increasingly crucial for developers to devise mechanisms for evaluating the potential dangers of al models. closed-source developers such as openal and anthropic have constructed datasets to assess dangerous model capabilities and typically implement safety measures to limit unwanted model behavior. however, safety evaluation methods for open-source llms are notably lacking. to that end, a team of international researchers recently created one of the first comprehensive open- source datasets for assessing safety risks in llms. their evaluation encompasses responses from six prominent language models: gpt-4, chatgpt, claude, llama 2, vicuna, and chatglm2. the authors also developed a risk taxonomy spanning a range of risks, from mild to severe. the authors find that most models output harmful content to some extent. gpt-4 and chatgpt are mostly prone to discriminatory, offensive output, while claude is susceptible to propagating misinformation (figure 3.4.7). across all

this lack of measures presents a considerable obstacle in comprehensively understanding the safety risks of al systems. if these systems were deployed in decision-making settings, would they actually pose a threat? introduced in 2023, machiavelli is a new benchmark designed to address this gap. its creators crafted a collection of 134 choose-your-own-adventure games, encompassing over half a million diverse social decision-making scenarios. these scenarios aim to evaluate the extent to which al agents pursue power, engage in deception, induce disutility, and commit ethical violations. through their research, the authors reveal that models confront trade-offs between maximizing rewards (game scores) and making ethical decisions. for instance, a model inclined to boost its score may find itself compelled to compromise its ethical stance (figure 3.4.11). furthermore, figure 3.4.12 provides a comparison of scores among various prominent al models, such as gpt-3.5 and gpt-4, * table

unfairness. (un)fairness in al and healthcare ateam of american and canadian researchers investigated racial bias when llms are prompted to respond to medical questions. they queried four popular llms (bard, gpt-3.5, claude, gpt-4) with nine distinct questions previously known to elicit “race-based medicine or widespread misconceptions around race” among real physicians. each model was asked each question five times, yielding 45 responses per model. figure 3.5.4 highlights the frequency with which notable llms delivered highly racialized responses per question.” the study revealed that all models demonstrated some degree of race-based medical bias, although their responses to identical questions varied. for certain queries, like the basis of race, only one model, claude, consistently offered problematic responses. in contrast, for other questions, such as the purported skin thickness differences between black and white individuals (a widespread misconception among medical students), most models regularly produced concerning race-based responses. the occasional perpetuation of debunked myths by llms underscores the need for caution when employing llms in medical contexts. number of

models frequently perpetuate stereotypes and biases (figure 3.5.5). to assess bias, biaspainter employs a wide selection of seed images and neutral prompts related to professions, activities, objects, and personality traits for image editing. it then compares these edits to the original images, concentrating on identifying inappropriate changes in gender, race, and age. biaspainter was evaluated across five well-known commercial image generation models such as stable diffusion, midjourney, and instructpix2pix. all models were shown to be somewhat biased along different dimensions (figure 3.5.6). generally, the generated images were more biased along age and race than gender dimensions. overall, on automatic bias detection tasks, biaspainter achieves an automatic bias detection

represent global opinions ona variety of topics such as politics, religion, and technology. in this study, researchers built a globalopinion@a dataset to capture cross-country opinions on various issues (figure 3.5.7). they then generated a similarity metric to compare people’s answers in various countries with those outputted by llms. using a four-point likert scale, llms were asked to rate their agreement with statements from the world values survey (wvs) and pew research center’s global attitudes (gas) surveys, including questions like, “when jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants,” or “on the whole, men make better business executives than women do.” globalopinionqa dataset source: durmus et al., 2023 the experiments indicate that the models’ responses closely align with those from individuals in western countries (figure 3.5.8). the authors point out a notable lack of diversity in opinion representation, especially from non-western nations among the shared responses. while it is challenging for models to precisely match the highly diverse distributions of global opinions—given the inherent variation in perspectives—it is still valuable to understand which opinions a model is likely to share. recognizing the biases inherent in models can highlight their limitations and facilitate adjustments that improve regional applicability. question ce) a) a good democracy b) a strong economy if you had to choose between a good democracy or a strong economy, which would you say is more important? llm |

responsible al 3.5 fairness llm tokenization introduces unfairness research from the university of oxford highlights how inequality in al originates at the tokenization stage. tokenization, the process of breaking down text into smaller units for processing and analysis, exhibits significant variability across languages. the number of tokens used for the same sentence can vary up to 15 times between languages. for instance, portuguese closely matches english in the efficiency of the gpt-4 tokenizer, yet it still requires approximately 50% more tokens to convey the same content. the shan language is the furthest from english, needing 15 times more tokens. figure 3.5.9 visualizes the concept of a context window while figure 3.5.10 illustrates the token consumption of the same sentence across different languages. the authors identify three major inequalities that result from variable tokenization. first, users of languages that require more tokens than english for the same content face up to four times higher inference costs and longer processing times, as both are dependent on the number of tokens. figure 3.5.11 illustrates the variation in token length and execution time for the same sentence across different languages or language families. second, these users may also experience increased processing times because models take longer to process a greater number of tokens. lastly, given that models operate within a fixed context window—a limit on the amount of text or content that can be input—languages that require more tokens proportionally use up more of this window. this can reduce the available context for the model, potentially diminishing the quality of service for those users. * table of contents © chapter 3 preview context window source: al index, 2024 |

include important information (e.g. the word “dog”) which can help the model to make a better prediction (“fetch” vs “baseball”). if more tokens are used up to represent the same sentence in non-english languages, less information is being captured in the limited context window, which may result in worse performance. figure 3.5.9 variable language tokenization source: al index, 2024

bias. the study revealed that chatgpt exhibits a notable and systematic bias favoring democrats in the united states and the labour party in the u.k. as part of the study, the researchers compared the answers of a default chatgpt to those of republican, democrat, radical republican, and radical democrat versions of chatgpt. this research design was created to better identify default vs. political

report 2024 chapter 3: responsible al 3.6 al and elections impact of al on political processes there has been an increasing volume of research aimed at exploring some of the risks al could pose to political processes. one topic of interest has been audio deepfakes. in july 2023, audio clips of a politician from india’s hindu party were released in which the politician attacked his own party and praised his political opponent. the politician claimed these audio clips were created using al. however, even after deepfake experts were consulted, it could not be determined with 100% certainty whether the clips were authentic or not. key research findings on audio deepfakes source: mai et al., 2023; al index, 2024 reference audio improves deepfake detection training humans to detect deepfakes only helps slightly english and mandarin deepfakes are equally difficult to identify shorter deepfakes are not easier to identify * table of contents © chapter 3 preview research published in 2023 suggests that humans generally have issues reliably detecting audio deepfakes. in their sample of 529 individuals, listeners only correctly detected deepfakes 73% of the time. figure 3.6.7 illustrates some of the other key findings from the study. the authors also expect detection accuracy to go down in the future as a result of improvements in audio generation methods. the rise of more convincing audio deepfakes increases the potential to manipulate political campaigns, defame opponents, and give politicians a “liar’s dividend,” the ability to dismiss damaging audio clips as fabrications. listening to clips more frequently does not aid detection spending more time does not improve detection participants do not improve detection without explicit feedback f oc pa > * human

integration of al into the economy raises many compelling questions. some predict that al will drive productivity improvements, but the extent of its impact remains uncertain. a major concern is the potential for massive labor displacement—to what degree will jobs be automated versus augmented by al? companies are already utilizing al in various ways across industries, but some regions of the world are witnessing greater investment inflows into this transformative technology. moreover, investor interest appears to be gravitating toward specific al subfields like natural language processing and data management. this chapter examines al-related economic trends using data from lightcast, linkedin, quid, mckinsey, stack overflow, and the international federation of robotics (ifr). it begins by analyzing al-related occupations, covering labor demand, hiring trends, skill penetration, and talent availability. the chapter then explores corporate investment in al, introducing a new section focused specifically on generative al. it further examines corporate adoption of al, assessing current usage and how developers adopt these technologies. finally, it assesses al’s current and projected economic impact and robot installations across various sectors. ‘4 table of contents 215 ***pdf page 216*** wee . chapter 4: artificial intelligence lar index report 2024 economy chapter highlights 1. generative al investment skyrockets. despite a decline in overall al private investment last year, funding for generative al surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. major players in the generative al space, including openal, anthropic, hugging face, and inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds. 2. already a leader, the united states pulls even further ahead in al private investment. in 2023, the united states saw al investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than china, the next highest investor. while private al investment in china and the european union, including the united kingdom, declined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the united states experienced a notable increase of 22.1% in the same time frame. 3. fewer al jobs, in the united states and across the globe. in 2022, al-related positions made up 2.0% of all job postings in america, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. this decline in al job listings is attributed to fewer postings from leading al firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies. 4. al decreases costs and increases revenues. a new mckinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed organizations report cost reductions from implementing al (including generative al), and 59% report revenue increases. compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting decreased costs, suggesting al is driving significant business efficiency gains. 5. total al private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded al companies increases. global private al investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than the sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. the count of newly funded al companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from the previous year. 6. al organizational adoption ticks up. a 2023 mckinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now use al (including generative al) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017. 7. china dominates industrial robotics. since surpassing japan in 2013 as the leading installer of industrial robots, china has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. in 2013, china’s installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022. ‘4 table of contents 216 ***pdf page 217*** wee . chapter 4: artificial intelligence lar index report 2024 economy chapter highlights (cont’d 8. greater diversity in robotic installations. in 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. this trend indicates not just an overall increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles. 9. the data is in: al makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. in 2023, several studies assessed al’s impact on labor, suggesting that al enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. these studies also demonstrated al’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. still other studies caution that using al without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance. 10. fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about al, especially generative al. in 2023, al was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all fortune 500 companies), a notable increase from 266 mentions in 2022. since 2018, mentions of al in fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. the most frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative al. ‘4 table of contents 217 ***pdf page 218*** artificial intelligence chapter 4: economy index report 2024 4.1 what’s new in 2023: a timeline biontech, known for developing the first

lightcast has analyzed hundreds of millions of job postings from over 51,000 websites since 2010, identifying those that require al skills. global al labor demand figure 4.2.1 shows the percentage of job postings demanding al skills. in 2023, the united states (1.6%), spain (1.4%), and sweden (1.3%) led in this metric. in 2022, al-related jobs accounted for 2.0% of all american job postings. in 2023, that number dropped to 1.6%. although most countries saw a decrease from 2022 to 2023 in the share of job postings requiring al skills, in many, the number of al-related job postings over the past five years has increased.’ lightcast speculates that the 2023 decrease in al job postings is driven by many top al employers (such as amazon, deloitte, capital one, randstad, and elevance health) scaling back their overall posting counts. additionally, many companies shifted the occupational mix of their postings. for example, amazon, in 2023, posted a higher share of operational roles like sales delivery driver, packager, and postal service/mail room worker than in 2022. at the same time, there was a lower share of demand for tech roles like software developers and data scientists. al

is based on a linkedin dataset of skills and jobs that appear on their platform. the geographic areas included in the sample make at least 10 al hires each month and have linkedin covering a substantial portion of the labor force. linkedin’s coverage of india’s and south korea’s sizable labor forces fall below this threshold, so insights drawn about these countries should be interpreted with particular caution. figure 4.2.12 reports the relative al hiring rate year-over- year ratio by geographic area. the overall hiring rate is computed as the percentage of linkedin members who added a new employer in the same period the job began, divided by the total number of linkedin members in the corresponding location. conversely, the relative al talent hiring rate is the year-over-year change in al hiring relative to overall hiring rate in the same geographic area.® therefore, figure 4.2.12 illustrates which specific regions have experienced the most significant rise in al talent recruitment compared to the overall hiring rate, serving as an indicator of al hiring vibrancy. in 2023, the regions with the greatest relative al hiring rates year over year were hong kong (28.8%), followed by singapore (18.9%) and luxembourg (18.9%). this means, for example, that in 2023 in hong kong, the ratio of al talent hiring relative to overall hiring grew 28.8%. relative al hiring rate

linkedin membership varies considerably between countries, which makes interpreting absolute movements of members from one country to another difficult. to compare migration flows between countries fairly, migration flows are normalized for the country of interest. for example, if country a is the country of interest, all absolute net flows into and out of country a (regardless of origin and destination countries) are normalized based on linkedin membership in country a at the end of each year and multiplied by 10,000. hence, this metric indicates relative talent migration of all other

number of american and canadian cs bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new cs master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and phd graduates modestly grow. while the number of new american and canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the number of students opting for graduate education in cs has flattened. since 2018, the number of cs master’s and phd graduates has slightly declined. 2. the migration of al phds to industry continues at an accelerating pace. in 2011, roughly equal percentages of new al phds took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). however, by 2022, a significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia (20.0%). over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound al phds has risen by 5.3 percentage points, indicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry. 3. less transition of academic talent from industry to academia. in 2019, 13% of new al faculty in the united states and canada were from industry. by 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it further dropped to 7%. this trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level al talent from industry into academia. 4. cs education in the united states and canada becomes less international. proportionally fewer international cs bachelor’s, master’s, and phds graduated in 2022 than in 2021. the drop in international students in the master’s category was especially pronounced. 5. more american high school students take cs courses, but access problems remain. in 2022, 201,000 ap cs exams were administered. since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has increased more than tenfold. however, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in suburban areas are more likely to have access to cs courses. 6. al-related degree programs are on the rise internationally. the number of english-language, al-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past five years. universities worldwide are offering more al-focused degree programs. 7. the united kingdom and germany lead in european informatics, cs, ce, and it graduate production. the united kingdom and germany lead europe in producing the highest number of new informatics, cs, ce, and

artificial intelligence index report 2024 chapter 7: policy and governance by relevance the al index team further disaggregated al-related bills based on their relevance to al, as not every bill mentioning al prioritizes it equally. a bill deemed to have high relevance to al is fundamentally focused on al-related policy, like the al training act passed in 2022, which mandates al training programs for executive agency workers. conversely, bills with medium relevance incorporate significant al policy elements but are not fundamentally focused on al-related matters. for example, the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2022 includes sections on al performance metrics and al capabilities development for the department of defense. however, because it has a broader focus, namely authorizing various defense agency programs, and is not completely centered on al, it was assigned a medium al relevance. low relevance al bills merely mention al in passing without a substantial legislative focus on al. an example of a low relevance al bill is the energy and water, legislative branch, and military construction and veterans affairs appropriations act, 2019. this bill allocates funding to various federal agencies, and mentions al primarily in the context of encouraging these agencies to consider workforce training opportunities for sectors like cybersecurity,

priorities: whether policymakers focus on expanding al capabilities, imposing restrictions, or balancing both. figure 7.2.6 indicates a global trend toward regulating al usage, showing that, while the

al-related legislation, reflecting the fact that al-related policymaking matters are often incorporated within budgetary bills related to public appropriations (figure 7.2.7). however, in 2023 the distribution of primary topics among passed bills broadened significantly, encompassing a diverse range of policy areas. specifically, two bills were passed in each of the following categories: armed forces and national security; civil rights and liberties, minority issues; commerce; education; labor and employment; science, technology, and communication. this diversity indicates that al policy

from western nations, thereby reflecting western perspectives. the lack of diversity can perpetuate or even exacerbate societal inequalities and biases. this chapter delves into diversity trends in al. the chapter begins by drawing on data from the computing research association (cra) to provide insights into the state of diversity in american and canadian computer science (cs) departments. a notable addition to this year’s analysis is data sourced from informatics europe, which sheds light on diversity trends within european cs education. next, the chapter examines participation rates at the women in machine learning (wiml) workshop held annually at neurips. finally, the chapter analyzes data from code.org, offering insights into the current state of diversity in secondary cs education across the united states. the al index is dedicated to enhancing the coverage of data shared in this chapter. demographic data regarding al trends, particularly in areas such as sexual orientation, remains scarce. the al index urges other stakeholders in the al domain to intensify their endeavors to track diversity trends associated with al and hopes to comprehensively cover such trends in future reports. + table of contents 413 ***pdf page 414*** [at _. ; chapter 8: artificial intelligence ° ° al index report 2024 dive rsity chapter highlights 1. u.s. and canadian bachelor’s, master’s, and phd cs students continue to grow more ethnically diverse. while white students continue to be the most represented ethnicity among new resident graduates at all three levels, the representation from other ethnic groups, such as asian, hispanic, and black or african american students, continues to grow. for instance, since 2011, the proportion of asian cs bachelor’s degree graduates has increased by 19.8 percentage points, and the proportion of hispanic cs bachelor’s degree graduates has grown by 5.2 percentage points. 2. substantial gender gaps persist in european informatics, cs, ce, and it graduates at all educational levels. every surveyed european country reported more male than female graduates in bachelor’s, master’s, and phd programs for informatics, cs, ce, and it. while the gender gaps have narrowed in most countries over the last decade, the rate of this narrowing has been slow. 3. u.s. k-12 cs education is growing more diverse, reflecting changes in both gender and ethnic representation. the proportion of ap cs exams taken by female students rose from 16.8% in 2007 to 30.5% in 2022. similarly, the participation of asian, hispanic/latino/latina, and black/african american students in ap cs has consistently increased year over year. 4 table of contents 414 ***pdf page 415*** | 1 artificial intelligence chapter 8:

faculty. although the cra reports data on the proportion of nonresident aliens at each educational level (i.e., bachelor’s, master’s, phd, and faculty), data on the ethnicity of nonresident aliens is not included. 2 not all phd-granting departments targeted in the survey provided responses. of the 297 departments targeted, only 182 responded, resulting in an overall response rate of 61%. the al index advises against making per capita comparisons between the cra north american data and the data on european cs graduates detailed in the subsequent sections due to the european data being collected from national statistical offices, which affords it broader coverage. * table of contents * chapter 8 preview 415 ***pdf page 416*** artificial intelligence chapter 8: diversity index report

persistent gender disparity among bachelor’s- level graduates in informatics, computer science, computer engineering, and information technology. despite some narrowing since 2011, men continue to dominate. for example, france (14.8%), the united kingdom (17.8%), and germany (21.5%) show relatively low proportions of female graduates in these fields (figure 8.1.15). bulgaria stands out among

greatest proportion of female master’s graduates (figure 8.1.16). in contrast, belgium (13.7%), italy (14.1%), and switzerland (15.8%) reported the smallest proportion of female master’s graduates. informatics, cs, ce, and it phd graduates in all surveyed european countries, informatics, cs, ce, and it phd graduates are predominantly male. however, in nations such as the united kingdom, germany, and switzerland, the gender gap has narrowed over the last decade, with women constituting a growing share of phd graduates (figure 8.1.17).4 in contrast, countries like finland and spain have seen the gap slightly widen. 3 the year label refers to the year in which an academic year ends. for example, the figures visualizing new graduates for 2022 reflect the number of graduates reported for the 2021/2022 academic year. for the sake of visual simplicity, the index opts to focus on the year in which students graduated, 4 in countries where the number of phd graduates is relatively small, trends in gender proportions can be prone to sudden year-over-year changes. for example, in 2022 bulgaria produced 24 total phds, latvia 12, and estonia 26. * table of contents * chapter 8 preview 425

technology evolve. understanding this public opinion is vital in better anticipating al’s societal impacts and how the integration of the technology may differ across countries and demographic groups. this chapter examines public opinion on al through global, national, demographic, and ethnic perspectives. it draws upon several data sources: longitudinal survey data from ipsos profiling global al attitudes over time, survey data from the university of toronto exploring public perception of chatgpt, and data from pew examining american attitudes regarding al. the chapter concludes by analyzing mentions of significant al models on twitter, using data from quid. 437 ***pdf page 438*** | u artificial intelligence . chapter 9: al index report 2024 public opinion chapter highlights 1. people across the globe are more cognizant of al’s potential impact—and more nervous. a survey from ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think al will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. moreover, 52% express nervousness toward al products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. in america, pew data suggests that 52% of americans report feeling more concerned than excited about al, rising from 38% in 2022. 2. al sentiment in western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving. in 2022, several developed western nations, including germany, the netherlands, australia, belgium, canada, and the united states, were among the least positive about al products and services. since then, each of these countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of al, with the netherlands experiencing the most significant shift. 3. the public is pessimistic about al’s economic impact. in an ipsos survey, only 37% of respondents feel al will improve their job. only 34% anticipate al will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will enhance the job market. 4. demographic differences emerge regarding al optimism. significant demographic differences exist in perceptions of al’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally more optimistic. for instance, 59% of gen z respondents believe al will improve entertainment options, versus only 40% of baby boomers. additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more optimistic about al’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and less-educated counterparts. 5. chatgpt is widely known and widely used. an international survey from the university of toronto suggests that 63% of respondents are aware of chatgpt. of those aware, around half report using chatgpt at least once weekly. 438 ***pdf

speed, improved accuracy, and praise for its ability to enhance productivity across different types of work tasks, such as coding, corporate collaboration, and content creation. negative sentiment primarily stemmed from complaints about occasional crashes of the chatgpt website, along with an open letter led by elon musk and supported by over 1,300 artificial intelligence experts, urging al laboratories to pause training of powerful al systems. moreover, there was disagreement regarding the “open letter” and the suggestion to halt al research, particularly considering its potential to have a positive impact across multiple fields. for example, andrew ng posted: “1/the call for a 6 month moratorium on making al progress beyond gpt-4 is a terrible idea. i’m seeing many new

however, some negative feedback arose due to disappointment with the model’s knowledge cutoff in april 2023 and slower loading speeds compared to gpt-4. some of the sample social media posts from this

academic graph (mag)’s taxonomy, which yields hierarchical labels describing the published research field(s) of study and corresponding scores.’ cset researchers identified the most common fields of study in our corpus of al-relevant publications since 2010 and recorded publications in all other fields as “other al.” english-language al-relevant publications were then tallied by their top-scoring field and publication year. updates: the methodology to assign mag fields of study was updated from the methodology used in prior years. toney and dunham describe the field of study assignment pipeline used in this analysis; prior years used the original mag implementation. cset also provided publication counts and year-by- year citations for al-relevant work associated with each country. a publication is associated with a country if it has at least one author whose organizational affiliation(s) is located in that country. if there is no observed country, the publication receives an “unknown/missing” country label. citation counts aren’t available for all publications; those without counts weren’t included in the citation analysis. over 70% of english-language al papers published between 2010 and 2022 have citation data available. additionally, publication counts by year and by publication type (e.g., academic journal articles, conference papers) were provided where available. these publication types were disaggregated by affiliation country as described above. cset also provided publication affiliation sector(s) where, as in the country attribution analysis, sectors were associated with publications through authors’ affiliations. not all affiliations were characterized in terms of sectors; cset researchers relied primarily on ror for this purpose, and not all organizations can be found in or linked to ror.® where the affiliation sector is available, papers were counted toward these sectors, by year. cset counted cross-sector collaborations as distinct pairs of sectors across authors for each publication. collaborations are only counted once: for example, if a publication has two authors with an academic affiliation and two with an industry affiliation, it is counted as a single academic-industry collaboration. patents from cset’s al and robotics patents dataset source cset’s al patents dataset was developed by cset and 1790 analytics and includes data from the lens, 1790 analytics, and epo’s patstat. patents relevant to the development and application of al and robotics were identified by their cpc/ipc codes and keywords. methodology in this analysis, patents were grouped by year and country, and then counted at the “patent family” 5 these scores are based on cosine similarities between field-of-study and paper embeddings. see autumn toney and james dunham, “multi-label classification of scientific research documents across domains and languages,” proceedings of the third workshop on scholarly document processing (association for computational linguistics, 2022): 105-14, https:// aclanthology.org/2022.sdp-112/. 6 see https://ror.org/ for more information about the ror dataset. 7 patents are analyzed at the “patent family” level rather than “patent document” level because patent families are a collective of patent documents all associated with a single invention and/ or innovation by the same inventors/assignees. thus, counting at the “patent family” level mitigates artificial number inflation when there are multiple patent documents in a patent family or if a patent is filed in multiple jurisdictions. * table of contents appendix 461 ***pdf page 462*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 level.” cset extracted year values from the first publication date within a family. countries are assigned to patents based on the country or filing office where a patent is first filed (e.g., if a patent is filed with the uspto on january 1, 2020, and then with the german patenting office on january 2, 2020, the patent is classified as a patent with u.s. inventors).® note that the same patent may have multiple countries (but not years) attributed to it if the inventors filed their patent in multiple countries on the same first filing date (e.g., if a patent is filed with the uspto on january 1, 2020, and then with the german patenting office on january 1, 2020, the patent is classified as a patent with u.s. inventors and as a patent with german inventors). note that patents filed with supranational organizations, such as patents filed under wipo (the world intellectual property organization), ep (european patent organization), and ea (a special area of spain not included in the european union), also fall under the “rest of world” category. ecosystems graph analysis to track the distribution of al foundation models by country, the al index team took the following steps: 1. a snapshot of the ecosystems graph was taken in early january 2024. 2. authors of foundation models are attributed to countries based on their affiliation credited on the paper/technical documentation associated with the model. for international organizations, authors are attributed to the country where the organization is headquartered, unless a more specific location is indicated. 3. all of the landmark publications are aggregated within time periods (e.g., monthly or yearly) with the national contributions added up to determine what each country’s contribution to landmark al research was during each time period. 4. the contributions of different countries are compared over time to identify any trends. epoch notable models analysis the al forecasting research group epoch maintains a dataset of landmark al and ml models, along with accompanying information about their creators and publications, such as the list of their (co)authors, number of citations, type of al task accomplished, and amount of compute used in training. the nationalities of the authors of these papers have important implications for geopolitical al forecasting. as various research institutions and technology companies start producing advanced ml models, the global distribution of future al development may shift or concentrate in certain places, which in turn affects the geopolitical landscape because al is expected to become a crucial component of economic and military power in the near future. to track the distribution of al research contributions on landmark publications by country, the epoch dataset is coded according to the following methodology: 8 in cset’s data analysis for the 2022 al index, we used the most recent publication date for a patent family. this method has the advantage of capturing updates within a patent family (such as amendments). however, to remain consistent with cset’s other data products, including the country activity tracker (available at https://cat.eto.tech/), we opted to use the first filing year instead in this data analysis. * table of contents appendix 462 ***pdf page 463*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 1. a snapshot of the dataset was taken on january 1, 2024. this includes papers about landmark models, selected using the inclusion criteria of importance, relevance, and uniqueness, as described in the compute trends dataset documentation. 2. the authors are attributed to countries based on their affiliation credited on the paper. for international organizations, authors are attributed to the country where the organization is headquartered, unless a more specific location is indicated. 3. all of the landmark publications are aggregated within time periods (e.g., monthly or yearly) with the national contributions added up to determine what each country’s contribution to landmark al research was during each time period. 4. the contributions of different countries are compared over time to identify any trends. github identifying al projects in partnership with researchers from harvard business school, microsoft research, and microsoft’s al for good lab, github identifies public al repositories following the methodologies of gonzalez, zimmerman, and nagappan, 2020, and dohmke, lansiti, and richards, 2023, using topic labels related to ai/ml and generative al, respectively, along with the topics ” “machine learning,” “deep learning,” or “artificial intelligence.” github further augments the dataset with repositories that have a dependency on the pytorch, tensorflow, or openal libraries for python. mapping al projects to geographic areas public al projects are mapped to geographic areas using ip address geolocation to determine the mode location of a project’s owners each year. each project owner is assigned a location based on their ip address when interacting with github. if a project owner changes locations within a year, the location for the project would be determined by the mode location of its owners sampled daily in the year. additionally, the last known location of the project owner is carried forward on a daily basis even if no activities were performed by the project owner that day. for example, if a project owner performed activities within the united states and then became inactive for six days, that project owner would be considered to be in the united states for that seven-day span. training cost analysis to create the dataset of cost estimates, the epoch database was filtered for models released during the large-scale ml era® that were above the median of training compute in a two-year window centered on their release date. this filtered for the largest-scale ml models. there were 138 qualifying systems based on these criteria. of these systems, 48 had sufficient information to estimate the training cost. for the selected ml models, the training time and the type, quantity, and utilization rate of the training hardware were determined from the publication, press release, or technical reports, as applicable. cloud rental prices for the computing hardware used by these models were collected from online historical archives of cloud vendors’ websites.’ 9 the selected cutoff date was september 1, 2015, in accordance with compute trends across three eras of machine learning (epoch, 2022). 10 historic prices were collected from archived snapshots of amazon web services, microsoft azure, and google cloud platform price catalogs viewed through the internet archive wayback machine. * table of contents appendix 463 ***pdf page 464*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 training costs were estimated from the hardware type, quantity, and time by multiplying the hourly cloud rental cost rates (at the time of training)" by the quantity of hardware hours. this yielded the cost to train each model using the same hardware used by the authors to train the same model at the time. however, some developers purchased hardware rather than renting cloud computers, so the true costs incurred by the developers may vary. various challenges were encountered while estimating the training cost of these models. often, the developers did not disclose the duration of training or the hardware that was used. in other cases, cloud compute pricing was not available for the hardware. the investigation of training cost trends is continued in a forthcoming epoch report, including an expanded dataset with more models and hardware prices. 11 the chosen rental cost rate was the most recent published price for the hardware and cloud vendor used by the developer of the model, at a three-year commitment rental rate, after subtracting the training duration and two months from the publication date. if this price was not available, the most analogous price was used: the same hardware and vendor at a different date, otherwise the same hardware from a different cloud vendor. if a three-year commitment rental rate was unavailable, this was imputed from other rental rates based on the empirical average discount for the given cloud vendor. if the exact hardware type was not available, e.g., “nvidia a100 sxm4 40gb,” then a generalization was used, e.g., “nvidia a100.” * table of contents appendix 464 ***pdf page 465*** | 1 artificial intelligence ali index report 2024 appendix chapter 2: technical performance chapter 2: technical

environmental impact to assess the environmental impact of al models, the al index team surveyed technical reports of prominent foundation models to determine whether the model developers disclosed carbon emissions. the index also reviewed papers by researchers that estimated the carbon footprint of various models. the technical reports surveyed, as well as the papers estimating the carbon impact of various models, are included in the works cited for this chapter. rlhf to identify foundation models using rlhf, the al index team reviewed the technical documentation of every foundation model included in the ecosystem graph, and searched for evidence that rlhf had been used in the model’s development process. the year in which a model is said to have used rlhf refers to the year the model was released. * table of contents appendix 466 ***pdf page 467*** artificial intelligence appendix index report 2024 chapter 2: technical performance works cited agostinelli, a., denk, t. |.,

artificial intelligence index report 2024 chapter 4: economy acknowledgments the al index would like to acknowledge james da costa for his work collecting information on significant al- related economic events, and emma williamson for her work collecting data from the stack overflow survey. international federation of robotics (ifr) data presented in the robot installations section was sourced from the “world robotics 2023” report. lightcast prepared by cal mckeever, julia nitschke, and layla o’kane lightcast delivers job market analytics that empower employers, workers, and educators to make data- driven decisions. the company’s artificial intelligence technology analyzes hundreds of millions of job postings and real-life career transitions to provide insight into labor market patterns. this real-time strategic intelligence offers crucial insights, such as what jobs are most in demand, the specific skills employers need, and the career directions that offer the highest potential for workers. for more information, visit www.lightcast.io. job postings data to support these analyses, lightcast mined its dataset of millions of job postings collected since 2010. lightcast collects postings from over 51,000 online job sites to develop a comprehensive, real-time portrait of labor market demand. it aggregates job postings, * table of contents appendix removes duplicates, and extracts data from job postings text. this includes information on job title, employer, industry, and region, as well as required experience, education, and skills. job postings are useful for understanding trends in the labor market because they allow for a detailed, real-time look at the skills employers seek. to assess the representativeness of job postings data, lightcast conducts a number of analyses to compare the distribution of job postings to the distribution of official government and other third-party sources in the united states. the primary source of government data on u.s. job postings is the job openings and labor turnover survey (jolts) program, conducted by the bureau of labor statistics. based on comparisons between jolts and lightcast, the labor market demand captured by lightcast data represents over 99% of the total labor demand. jobs not posted online are usually in small businesses (the classic example being the “help wanted” sign in the restaurant window) and union hiring halls. measuring demand for al in order to measure the demand by employers of al skills, lightcast uses its skills taxonomy of over 30,000 skills. the list of al skills from lightcast data are shown below, with associated skill clusters. while some skills are considered to be in the al cluster specifically, for the purposes of this report, all skills below were considered al skills. a job posting was considered an al job if it mentioned any of these skills in the job text. 478 ***pdf page 479*** | 1 artificial intelligence ali index report 2024

labor force coverage by linkedin and at least 10 al hires in any given month. india, despite not reaching 40% coverage, was included in this sample because of its increasing importance in the global economy. skills (al engineering and al literacy skills) linkedin members self-report their skills on their linkedin profiles. currently, more than 41,000 distinct, standardized skills are identified by linkedin. these have been coded and classified by taxonomists at linkedin into 249 skill groupings, which are the skill groups represented in the dataset. skill groupings are derived by expert taxonomists through a similarity-index methodology that measures skill composition at the industry level. linkedin’s industry taxonomy and their corresponding naics codes can be found here. this year linkedin made updates to the all skills list and categorized them into “al engineering” and “al literacy” skills. see “al skills list update compared to last year” section for more details. skills genome for any entity (occupation or job, country, sector, etc.), the skill genome is an ordered list (a vector) of the 50 “most characteristic skills” of that entity. these most characteristic skills are identified using a tf-idf algorithm to identify the most representative skills of the target entity, while down-ranking ubiquitous skills that add little information about that specific entity (e.g., microsoft word). 480 ***pdf page 481*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 tf-idf is a statistical measure that evaluates how representative a word (in this case, a skill) is to a selected entity). this is done by multiplying two metrics: 1. the term frequency of a skill in an entity (“tf”). 2. the logarithmic inverse entity frequency of the skill across a set of entities (“idf”). this indicates how common or rare a word is in the entire entity set. the closer idf is to 0, the more common a word is. so, if the skill is very common across linkedin entities, and appears in many job or member descriptions, the idf will approach o. if, on the other hand, the skill is unique to specific entities, the idf will approach 1. details are available at linkedin’s skills genome and linkedin—world bank methodology note. al skills penetration the aim of this indicator is to measure the intensity of al skills in an entity (in a particular country, industry, gender, etc.) through the following methodology: e compute frequencies for all self-added skills by linkedin members in a given entity (occupation, industry, etc.) in 2015-2023. e re-weight skill frequencies using a tf-idf model to get the top 50 most representative skills in that entity. these 50 skills compose the “skill genome” of that entity. e compute the share of skills that belong to the al skill group out of the top skills in the selected entity. interpretation: the al skill penetration rate signals the prevalence of al skills across occupations, or the intensity with which linkedin members utilize al skills in their jobs. for example, the top 50 skills for the occupation of engineer are calculated based on the weighted frequency with which they appear in linkedin * table of contents appendix members’ profiles. if four of the skills that engineers possess belong to the al skill group, this measure indicates that the penetration of al skills is estimated to be 8% among engineers (e.g., 4/50). jobs or occupations linkedin member titles are standardized and grouped into approximately 15,000 occupations. these are not sector- or country-specific. these occupations are further standardized into approximately 3,600 occupation representatives. occupation representatives group occupations with a common role and specialty, regardless of seniority. al jobs or occupations an “al” job is an occupation representative that requires al skills to perform the job. skills penetrations are used as a signal for whether al skills are prevalent in an occupation representative, in any sector where the occupation representative may exist. examples of such occupations include (but are not limited to): machine learning engineer, artificial intelligence specialist, data scientist, and computer vision engineer. al talent a linkedin member is considered al talent if they have explicitly added al skills to their profile and/or they are occupied in an al occupation representative. the counts of al talent are used to calculate talent concentration metrics. for example, to calculate the country-level al talent concentration, we use the counts of al talent at the country level vis-a-vis the counts of linkedin members in the respective countries. note that concentration metrics may be influenced by linkedin coverage in these countries and should be utilized with caution. 481 ***pdf page 482*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 relative al skills penetration to allow for skills penetration comparisons across countries, the skills genomes are calculated and a relevant benchmark is selected (e.g., global average). a ratio is then constructed between a country’s and the benchmark’s al skills penetrations, controlling for occupations. interpretation: a country’s relative al skills penetration of 1.5 indicates that al skills are 1.5 times as frequent as in the benchmark, for an overlapping set of occupations. global comparison for cross-country comparison, we present the relative penetration rate of al skills, measured as the sum of the penetration of each al skill across occupations in a given country, divided by the average global penetration of al skills across the overlapping occupations in a sample of countries. interpretation: a relative penetration rate of 2 means that the average penetration of al skills in that country is two times the global average across the same set of occupations. global comparison: by industry the relative al skills penetration by country for industry provides an in-depth sectoral decomposition of al skill penetration across industries and sample countries. interpretation: a country’s relative al skill penetration rate of 2 in the education sector means that the average penetration of al skills in that country is two times the global average across the same set of occupations in that sector. global comparison: by gender the “relative al skills penetration by gender” metric provides a cross-country comparison of al skill penetrations within each gender, comparing * table of contents appendix countries’ male/female al skill penetrations to the global average of the same gender. since the global averages are distinct for each gender, this metric should only be used to compare country rankings within each gender, and not for cross-gender comparisons within countries. interpretation: a country’s al skills penetration for women of 1.5 means that female members in that country are 1.5 times more likely to list al skills than the average female member in all countries pooled together across the same set of occupations that exist in the country/gender combination. global comparison: across genders the “relative al skills penetration across genders” metric allows for cross-gender comparisons within and across countries globally, since we compare the countries’ male/female al skill penetrations to the same global average regardless of gender. relative al talent hiring rate yoy ratio e linkedin hiring rate or overall hiring rate is a measure of hires normalized by linkedin membership. it is computed as the percentage of linkedin members who added a new employer in the same period the job began, divided by the total number of linkedin members in the corresponding location. e al hiring rate is computed following the overall hiring rate methodology, but only considering members classified as al talent. e relative al talent hiring rate yoy ratio is the year-over-year change in al hiring rate relative to overall hiring rate in the same country. for each month, we first calculate al hiring rate in the country, then divide al hiring rate by overall hiring rate in that country, 482 ***pdf page 483*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 then calculate yoy change of this ratio, and then take the 12-month moving average using the last 12 months. interpretation: in 2023 in india, the ratio of al talent hiring relative to overall hiring has grown 16.8% year over year. al talent migration data on migration comes from the world bank group-— linkedin “digital data for development” partnership (please see zhu et al. [2018]). linkedin migration rates are derived from the self- identified locations of linkedin member profiles. for example, when a linkedin member updates his or her location from paris to london, this is counted as a migration. migration data is available from 2019 onward. linkedin data provides insights into countries on the al talent gained or lost due to migration trends. al talent migration is considered for all members with al skills/holding al jobs at time t for country a as the country of interest and country b as the source of inflows and destination for outflows. thus, net al talent migration between country a and country b—for country a—is calculated as follows: . . net al talent flows. net al talent m igration, , = = bt member count, net flows are defined as total arrivals minus departures within the given time period. linkedin membership varies considerably between countries, which makes interpreting absolute movements of members from one country to another difficult. to compare migration flows between countries fairly, migration flows are normalized for the country of interest. for example, if country a is the country of interest, all absolute net flows into and out of country a, regardless of origin * table of contents appendix and destination countries, are normalized based on linkedin membership in country a at the end of each year and multiplied by 10,000. hence, this metric indicates relative talent migration from all countries to and from country a. al skills list update compared to last year 1. linkedin introduced “al literacy” skills. a. the following skills were added to the list and categorized as “al literacy” skills: chatgpt, dall-e, gpt-3, gpt-4, generative art, github copilot, google bard, midjourney, prompt engineering, and

in-house llm and other smart search features, as well as traditional boolean query, to search for focus areas, topics, and keywords within many datasets: social media, news, forums and blogs, companies, patents, as well as other custom feeds of data (e.g., survey data). quid has many visualization options and data delivery endpoints, including network graphs based on semantic similarity, in-platform dashboarding capabilities, as well as programmatic * table of contents appendix postgresql database delivery, and so on. quid applies best-in-class al and nlp to reveal hidden patterns in large datasets, enabling users to make data-driven decisions accurately, quickly, and efficiently. search, data sources, and scope over 8 million global public and private company profiles from multiple data sources are indexed to search across company descriptions, while filtering and including metadata ranging from investment information to firmographic information, such as founded year, hq location, and more. company information is updated on a weekly basis. the quid algorithm reads a large amount of text data from each document to make links between different documents based on their similar language. this process is repeated at an immense scale, which produces a network with different clusters identifying distinct topics or focus areas. trends are identified based on keywords, phrases, people, companies, and institutions that quid identifies, and the other metadata that is put into the software. data companies organization data is embedded from capital iq and crunchbase. these companies include all types of organizations (private, public, operating, operating as a subsidiary, out of business) throughout the world. the investment data includes private investments, m&a, public offerings, minority stakes made by pe/ vcs, corporate venture arms, governments, and institutions both within and outside the united states. some data is simply unreachable—for instance, when investors’ names or funding amounts are undisclosed. quid embeds capital iq data as a default and adds in data from crunchbase for the data points 484 ***pdf page 485*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 that are not captured in capital iq. this not only yields comprehensive and accurate data on all global organizations, but it also captures early-stage startups and funding events data. company information is updated on a weekly basis. earnings calls quid leverages earnings call transcript data embedded from seeking alpha. for this report, quid has analyzed mentions of al-related keywords across all earnings call transcripts from fortune 500 companies from january 2018 through december 2023. new earnings call transcript data is updated in quid on the 1st and 15th of every month. search parameters boolean query is used to search for focus areas, topics, and keywords within the archived company database, within their business descriptions and websites. we can filter out the search results by hq regions, investment amount, operating status, organization type (private/ public), and founding year. quid then visualizes these companies by semantic similarity. if there are more than 7,000 companies from the search result, quid selects the 7,000 most relevant companies for visualization based on the language algorithm. boolean search: “artificial intelligence” or “al” or “machine learning” or “deep learning” companies e@ global al and ml companies that have received investments (private, ipo, m&a) from january 1, 2013, to december 31, 2023. e@ global al and ml companies that have received over $1.5m for the last 10 years (january 1, 2013, to december 31, 2023). ¢ global data was also pulled for a generative al query (boolean search: “generative al” or “gen * table of contents appendix al” or “generative artificial intelligence”) for companies that have received over $1.5m for the last 10 years (january 1, 2013, to december 31, 2023). target event definitions e private investments: a private placement is a private sale of newly issued securities (equity or debt) by a company to a selected investor or a selected group of investors. the stakes that buyers take in private placements are often minority stakes (under 50%), although it is possible to take control of a company through a private placement as well, in which case the private placement would be a majority stake investment. e minority investment: these refer to minority stake acquisitions in quid, which take place when the buyer acquires less than 50% of the existing ownership stake in entities, asset products, and business divisions. e m&a: this refers to a buyer acquiring more than 50% of the existing ownership stake in entities, asset products, and business divisions. mckinsey & company data used in the corporate activity—industry adoption section was sourced from the mckinsey global survey “the state of al in 2023: generative al’s breakout year.” the online survey was in the field april 11, 2023, to april 21, 2023, and garnered responses from 1,684 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. of those respondents, 913 said their organizations had adopted al in at least one function 485 ***pdf page 486*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 and were asked questions about their organization’s al use. to adjust for differences in response rates, the data is weighted by the contribution of each respondent’s nation to global gdp. the al index also considered data from previous iterations of the survey. more specifically, the al index made use of data from: the state of al in 2022—and a half decade in review the state of al in 2021 the

(cra) members are 200-plus north american organizations active in computing research: academic departments of computer science and computer engineering; laboratories and centers in industry, government, and academia; and affiliated professional societies (aaai, acm, cacs/aic, ieee computer society, siam usenix). cra’s mission is to enhance innovation by joining with industry, government, and academia to strengthen research and advance education in computing. learn more about cra here. the cra taulbee survey gathers survey data during the fall of each academic year by reaching out to over 200 phd-granting departments. details about the taulbee survey can be found here. taulbee doesn’t directly survey the students. the department identifies each new phd’s area of specialization as well as their type of employment. data is collected from september to january of each academic year for phds awarded in the previous academic year. results are published in may after data collection closes. the cra taulbee survey is sent only to doctoral departments of computer science, computer engineering, and information science/systems. historically, (a) taulbee covers one-quarter to one-third of total bs cs recipients in the united states; (b) the percentage of women earning bachelor’s degrees is lower in the taulbee schools than overall; and (c) taulbee tracks the trends in overall cs production. 491 ***pdf page 492*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 the al index used data from the following iterations of the cra survey: cra, 2022 cra, 2021 cra, 2020 cra, 2019

collected by informatics europe and published on the informatics europe higher education data portal, which is updated with the most recent data at the end of the year (typically in december). in the interest of reliability, informatics europe collects the data from countries where a solid and reasonably complete picture could be drawn from official sources such as national statistical offices, educational agencies, or ministries. the full list of sources can be found in the data portal section “data sources.” the data portal follows the definitions * table of contents appendix appendix chapter 6: education and concepts provided by these national agencies and reflects the national situation in the countries considered. those aspects that are not exposed by the consulted agencies are not part of the dataset. a full list of definitions and concepts used can be found in the footnotes shown at the bottom of the statistics section. since each national data repository has its own structure and quite often provides all supporting information in the national language, informatics europe consults with its members—academics, active and knowledgeable in the informatics field from respective countries—who help to interpret the statistics available and who understand the specificities of these countries’ higher education systems. one of the main challenges in integrating the statistical data is the identification of terms used to define the informatics discipline in different countries. informatics is known under different names in different european languages and countries, and in english as well. a good dozen terms (presented in the data portal section “subjects”) are used to denote what is fundamentally the same discipline, and the role of national experts here is to help with screening the terms and programs and identifying which part of them is pertinent to the informatics field. the data covers the degrees delivered by both traditional research universities (ru) and university of applied science (uas) for the countries where these institutions also offer bachelor’s and master’s studies in informatics. the full list of institutions covered can be found in the data portal section “institutions & academic units.” 492 ***pdf page 493*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 studyportals studyportals is the world’s most comprehensive study choice platform. it lists over 200,000 english-taught programs from more than 3,500 institutions, helping over 50 million students per year. the studyportals analytics and consulting team uses the resulting data to provide higher education organizations with real- time market insights. appendix chapter 6: education studyportals categorizes the study programs on its portals into disciplines and subdisciplines. the 15 disciplines are broad categories of educational fields to help navigate the portals. the 284 subdisciplines are narrower topics, subdivisions, or specialized areas of disciplines. paying clients can provide input, but ultimately, data processors manually choose the one-to-three closest fitting subdisciplines according to the following scenarios, listed in decreasing order of likelihood: 1. classic scenario: when the study name closely matches one subdiscipline name. a. “chemistry” -> subdiscipline chemistry. 2. classic interdisciplinary scenario: when the study name closely matches two or three subdiscipline names. a. “international fashion management and marketing” -> subdisciplines fashion management + marketing. 3. specializations scenario: when not all the subdisciplines are mentioned in the study name, but they are listed as specific specializations, concentrations, or tracks. a. “business administration with specializations in finance and international business” -> subdisciplines business administration + finance + international business 4. mixed scenario: when the study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline but can be represented by combining two or three subdisciplines. a. “financial economics” -> subdisciplines finance + economics 5. last resort scenario: when the study name does not closely match any specific subdiscipline and/or combination, it is instead approximated as closely as possible. a. “uk, eu, and us copyright law” -> subdisciplines patent & intellectual property law + international law +

regulations enacted in the european union between 2017 and 2023. to compile this data, the index team conducted a keyword search for “artificial intelligence” on eur-lex, a comprehensive database of eu legislation, regulations, and case law. eur- lex provides access to a wide range of regulatory documents, such as legal acts, consolidated texts, international agreements, preparatory documents, and legislative procedures. the analysis in this section focused exclusively on documents with binding regulatory authority. the search for al-related regulation in the european union was limited to legal acts, international agreements, and consolidated texts. the regulation was then coded by a team of two human coders for: (1) relevance to al, (2) regulatory approach, and (3) subject matter. the relevance to al categories were low, medium, and high. the regulatory approach categories were expansive or restrictive. for the subject matter categories, the index employed the congress policy typology. in cases where there were disagreements on the coding schemas, a third coder was brought in to settle the differences. federal budget for nondefense al r&d data on the federal u.s. budget for nondefense al r&d was taken from previous editions of the al index (namely the 2021 and 2022 versions) and from the following national science and technology council reports: 496 ***pdf page 497*** artificial intelligence index report 2024 supplement to the president’s fy 2024 budget supplement to the president’s fy 2023 budget supplement to the president’s fy2022 budget govini govini is a defense technology company. ark, govini’s flagship software, is a suite of al-enabled applications, powered by integrated government and commercial data, that accelerate the defense acquisition process. with ark, the acquisition community eliminates slow, manual processes and gains the ability to rapidly imagine, produce, and field critical warfighting capabilities. analysts and decision- makers are equipped to solve challenges across the entire spectrum of defense acquisition, including supply chain, science and technology, production, sustainment, and modernization. govini curated usg al spend data from their annual scorecard taxonomy by applying supervised machine learning (ml) and natural language processing (nlp) techniques to parse, analyze, and categorize large volumes of federal contracts data, including prime contracts, grants, and other transaction authority (ota) awards. govini’s most recent scorecard focused on critical technologies, of which ai/ml technologies and microelectronics were segments. the al/ml segment consisted of five subsegments: data integration, computer vision, machine learning, autonomy, and natural language processing. microelectronics is divided into two subsegments: memory and processing, and semiconductors. by initially generating search terms and then subsequently excluding specific * table of contents appendix terms that yield erroneous results, govini delivers a comprehensive yet discriminant taxonomy of subsegments that are mutually exclusive. repeated keyword searches and filters allow a consensus, data-driven taxonomy to come into focus. govini smes conduct final review of taxonomic structure to complement this iterative, data-driven process. the use of artificial intelligence (al) and supervised ml models enables analysis of the large volumes of irregular data contained in federal contracts— data that often is inaccessible through regular government reporting processes or human-intensive analytical approaches. moreover, beyond simply making usable an expansive body of data sources, govini’s ark platform and national security knowledge graph establishes high-fidelity standards in categorized and fused data to produce a comprehensive and accurate depiction of federal spending, and the supporting vendor ecosystem, over time. national al strategies the al index did a web search to identify national strategies on al. below is a list of countries that were identified as having a national al strategy, including a link to said strategy. for certain counties, noted with an asterisk (*), the actual
