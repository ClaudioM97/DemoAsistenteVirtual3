creating a seamless phygital experience is essential. take a look at these key elements and consider a smooth transition to a unique customer journey that will bridge the best parts of the online and offline worlds. element #1: a solid phygital plan completing a retail transformation from omnichannel to a complete phygital experience isn’t as simple as adding new technology into a store. retailers interested in adopting this strategy should assess their current operations online and in- store to identify gaps and understand how phygital technology could fill them. perhaps in-store sales reps do not maintain accurate records of inventory. with a phygital strategy, they can see inventory across store locations and within a fulfillment center. conversely, if a brand’s website states that a product is in stock at a certain store, the information will be accurate and sales reps can get what they need. knowing these gaps and pain points will help retailers devise the best phygital strategy

ecommerce- success/) source: rd.ntt (https://www.rd.ntt/e/research/jn20191110_h.html) many ecommerce retailers use customer data to offer a more personalized experience. they leverage previous purchase history, interactions on the website, and other information to create personalized banner ads, abandoned cart messages, and more based on what’s in stock. instead of only using this data online, physical retailers should offer the same insights into stock management and product information to provide personalized recommendations. when inventory and other data are managed through the same system in-store and on the website, customers can decide whether to order a product online or pick it up in the store. retailers can also better use customer data to offer personalized coupons, sales, or promotions. element #3: staggered implementation source: pickcel (https://www.pickcel.com/blog/benefits- of-using-digital-product-catalogs-for- your-retail-business/) phygital technology is a critical component of the experience. however, transforming a brick-and-mortar store takes time and patience. retailers need to choose what they want to implement the most and implement changes in stages. instead of overhauling in-store tech and replacing salespeople with chatbots, take it slow. add some chatbots and question-and-answer stations or online product catalogs within the store. supplement them with in-store personnel and events to demonstrate products and offer the human touch. element #4: using the right platform source: digitaldoughnut (https://www.digitaldoughnut.com/articles/2015/august/let- s-get-phygital!) before setting up phygital technology in a store, list some desired features and do some comparison shopping. a retailer aiming for seamless fulfillment or virtual product demonstrations should list vendors and compare them based on pricing, features, customer service, and other factors. they should also develop questions and answers and interview different vendors to understand how the technology fits into their goals for a phygital retail environment. screwfix's marketing strategy: the story behind the
