i expect slight decrease stay the same expect slight increase _. ; significant increase ready to increase your investment and improve your customers experience? let's get started. what is customer experience? customer experience (also known as cx) is defined by the interactions and experiences your customer with your business throughout the entire customer journey, from first contact to becoming a happy and in o bb has cx is an integral part of customer relationship management (crm) and the reason why it’s important is because a customer who has a positive experience with a business is more likely to become a repeat and loyal customer. in fact, according to a global cx study by oracle found that 74% of senior executives believe that customer experience impacts the willingness of a customer to be a loyal advocate. if you want your customers to loyal, you have to invest in their experience! customer experience and loyalty customer experience impacts willingess to be loyal customers have more power today than 3 years ago customers switch brand due to poor experience customers are willing to pay for better experience simply put, happy customers remain loyal. it makes sense, right? the happier you are with a brand, the longer you stay with them. so, if you treat your customers poorly or ignore their customer service emails, then they are more likely to stop doing business with you. this is why companies that deliver a superior customer experience outperform their competitors - and this means they'll be spending more with your business (and less in theirs!). for example, here's a few statistics that caught our eye: customer experience is set to be the number one brand differentiator 1 in 3 customers will leave a brand they love after just one bad experience, customers are willing to pay a price premium of up to 13% (and as high as 18%) for luxury and indulgence services, simply by receiving a great customer experience, stay 49% of buyers have made impulse purchases after receiving a more personalized customer experience. customers that rate companies with a high customer experience score (i.e. 10/10) spend 140% more and loyal for up to 6 years. annual revenue increase per customer so, it's extremely important that you focus on improving the experience you offer your customers. and we're not just talking about customer service.... is customer experience the same as customer service? no. and here's why. in most cases, a customer’s first point of contact with a company is usually by interacting with an employee (either by visiting a store or by speaking on the phone). this gives your business an opportunity to deliver great customer service. however, customer service is only one aspect of the entire customer experience. for instance, when booking a vacation over the phone, good customer service is evident when the person assisting you is friendly and helpful. however, a great customer experience goes way beyond that. for example, it's when your tickets arrive ahead of time, you get an extra special discount and the hotel surprises you with a room upgrade right when you enter the door. that's how these two differ. like most things in today’s marketplace, customer experience has changed - it’s more than person-to- person service and thanks to technology, companies can connect with their customers in new and exciting remain for example, using crm software, you can view customer purchase history and to predict future needs even before the customer knows they need it. having the ability to predict a future need will let you be proactive and attentive and, it means you can do things like; understand the 360 degree view of the customer customer service is still as important as ever, but it’s no longer the sole focus of the customer experience. now, the customer experience brings new ways to strengthen customer relationships through technological breakthroughs. the table below explains the key differences between customer service and customer experience: how important is the customer experience? a business cannot exist without its customers, and this is why companies are focusing on how to win new business and, perhaps more importantly, retain existing customers. did you know that companies that prioritize great customer experience see a significant increase in their revenue? plus, a survey by bloomberg businessweek found that “delivering a great customer experience” has become top strategic objective. and a survey by customer management iq survey found that 75% of customer experience management executives and leaders rated customer experience a‘5’ ona scale of 1-5 (5 being of the highest importance). provide related products based on purchase history create and deliver targeted email marketing campaigns a importance of the customer experience to the organization the challenge here is that even though it's a high priority, most companies are failing to deliver a good customer experience. when bain & company asked organizations to rate their quality of customer experience, 80% believe are delivering a superior experience. this is compared to only 8% of customers who believe they are receiving a great customer experience. so how many brands are truly delivering an excellent customer experience? customer expectations are rising, faster than the speed that companies can improve their customer experience. customers expect every interaction, end-to-end, to be the best experience they have with any company - not just yours! superoffice crm gives you a holistic view of each customer by capturing every interaction in one platform - from sales, marketing and customer service. you can use this data to provide a better customer experience. want to learn more?

9 ways to improve the customer experience let’s take a look at 9 ways to create a great customer experience strategy to help you improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn and increase revenues - including examples. create a clear customer experience vision the first step in your customer experience strategy is to have a clear customer-focused vision that you communicate with your organization. the easiest way to define this vision is to create a set of statements that act as guiding principles. for example, zappos use their core family values and these values are embedded into their culture, which includes delivering wow through service, being humble and embracing change. once these principles are in place, they will drive the behavior of your organization. every member of your team should know these principles by heart and they should be embedded into all areas of training and development. understand who your customers are next step in building upon these customer experience principles is to bring to life the different types customers who deal with your customer support teams. if your organization is going to really understand the of can of customer needs and wants, then they need to be able to connect and empathize with the situations that your customers face. one way to do this is to segment your customers and create personas (or customer profiles). try to give each persona a name and personality. for example, anne is 35 years old; she likes new technology and is tech savvy enough to follow a video tutorial on her own, whereas john (42 years old) needs to be able to follow clear instructions on a web page. by creating personas, your customer support team can recognize who they are and understand them better. it's also an important step in becoming truly customer centric. create an emotional connection with your customers you’ve heard the phrase “it’s not what you say; it’s how you say it”? well, the best customer experiences are achieved when a member of your team creates an emotional connection with a customer. when a customer was late on returning a pair of shoes due to her mother passing away. when zappos found out what happened, they took care of the return shipping and had a courier pick up the shoes without cost. but, zappos didn't stop there. the next day, the customer arrived home to a bouquet of flowers with a note from the zappos customer success team who sent their condolences. research by the journal of consumer research has found that more than 50% of an experience is based on an emotion as emotions shape the attitudes that drive decisions. customers become loyal because they are emotionally attached and they remember how they feel when they use a product or service. a business that optimizes for an emotional connection outperforms competitors by 85% in sales growth. positive experience for customers means a lot, studies prove time and again: 64% of consumers are more likely to recommend a brand to others if it offers simpler experiences and communications. 71% of people recommend a product or service because they received a “great experience’. 65% of all consumers find a positive experience with a brand to be more influential than great advertising capture customer feedback in real time how can you tell if you are delivering a wow customer experience? you need to ask - and ideally you do this by capturing feedback in real time. use live chat tools to have real time conversations and when done, send a follow up email to every customer using post-interaction surveys and similar customer experience tools. one of the best examples of creating an emotional connection comes from zappos: a superoffice service helps you collect feedback in real time, through email-based support, live chat and a self-service knowledge base. find out more and book a free demo. course, it’s possible to make outbound sales calls to customers in order to gain more insightful feedback. also important to tie customer feedback to a specific customer support agent, which shows every team member the difference they are making to the business. use a quality framework for development of your team following the steps above, you now know what customers think about the quality of your service compared to the customer experience principles you have defined. the next step is to identify the training needs for each individual member of your customer support team. many organizations assess the quality of phone and email communication, however, a quality framework takes this assessment one step further by scheduling and tracking your teams development through coaching, elearning and group training. act upon regular employee feedback most organizations have an annual survey process where they capture the overall feedback of your team; how engaged they are and the businesses ability to deliver an exceptional service. but, what happens in the 11 months between these survey periods? usually, nothing happens. and this is where continuous employee feedback can play a role using tools that allow staff to share ideas on how to improve the customer experience and for managers to see how staff feeling towards the business. for example, using project management software or social media tools, you can create a closed environment where your organization can leave continuous feedback. measure the roi from delivering great customer experience and finally, how do you know if all this investment in your teams, process and technology are working and off? the answer is in the business results. measuring customer experience is one of the biggest challenges faced by organizations, which is why many companies use the “net promoter score” or nps, which collects valuable information by asking a single straightforward question: "how likely are you to recommend us?" of it’s by is paying of superoffice based on your total experience with superoffice as a company (solutions and services) last 6 months: how likely are you to recommend us to someone looking for crm?
