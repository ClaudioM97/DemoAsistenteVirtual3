oo introduction retailers should embrace the changing consumer and consider strategic investments that could enable profitable growth during inflationary times 1 in addition, many retailers face difficult year-over-year comparisons from nesting preferences during pandemic lockdowns that created a strong durable goods cycle. other retailers benefited from government stimuli and consumers returning to work and school and are now left forecasting and providing guidance based on trends that can be difficult to decipher, if structural or episodic. but the retail outlook is not all gloom and doom; retailers have learned much about resiliency in the past few years. massive demand fluctuations during the pandemic forced retailers to rethink archaic systems in favor of more pliable operations. seemingly overnight, retailers rolled out health and safety protocols and established omnichannel capabilities. and they learned that rapidly evolving consumer preferences require more effective analytics and tools to build loyalty. if anything, the past few years should give executives confidence in their ability to weather the next storm the work for executives in 2023 is to advance the innovations created during the pandemic: to drive more profit from the curated experiences, last-mile options, and conveniences that retailers rolled out—all at a time when the purse strings may need to tighten. to check the pulse of retail executives, we asked 50 leaders about their expectations regarding challenges and opportunities in the upcoming year. we wanted to better understand what traits separate leaders from the rest of the pack and analyze planned strategies and investments for 2023. the results provide a unique outlook on how today's market, future expectations, and changing consumer needs inform strategies for the year(s) ahead. economic outlook for the retail industry a note from deloitte us economists danny bachman and akrur barua three key

challenging environment a changing relationship with consumers as noted in the economic outlook, shifting consumer behavior will likely weigh heavily on retailers in 2023. and other consumer transformations will likely compound the issue may come as no surprise that customer acquisition and retention this situation could become more problematic in 2023. nearly all executives in our survey say consumers will expect a seamless shopping experience across channels in the upcoming year. but they expect consumers to be significantly more price-conscious, making consumers more likely to shift from source to source, powered by peer recommendations and price comparison shopping as they go. figure 3. the changing consumer wealth distribution 12 a millennial at age 40 has 13 rising obesity

to investigate whether top-performing retailers exhibit any common behaviors. 26 for those retailers that analysts expect to be top performers going forward, exposure to relatively resilient segments and strong balance sheets have bolstered their sentiment. in addition, meaningful progress on key long-term strategic initiatives to create efficiencies is seen in a favorable light: • supply chain • omnichannel and tapping into loyalty programs 27 given these macro consumer shifts, sell-side wall street analysts are painting a bleak picture for the industry. of the top 10 performing companies we examined, only three were predicted to have eps growth over the next three years. • digital leaders have prioritized areas for moderate to major investments unlike laggards, which are planning for minimal to moderate investments across areas, leaders tend to prioritize investment in areas such as marketing and merchandising, omnichannel capabilities, digital transformation, and supply chain leaders vs. laggards executive survey: identifying leaders and laggards we see these themes echoed when we examine leaders with self- reported top-line and operating margin growth expectations in our survey. leaders tend to be data-driven and can swiftly respond to the changing consumer. they prioritize investments in marketing and merchandising, omnichannel capabilities, digital transformation, and supply chain. given that many leaders are confident in their company’s ability to successfully execute business strategy and maintain or grow margins even in turbulent times, their methods may act as a road map to a more profitable future 1. execute 2. maintain 3. expectations revenue 4. expectations change based on their aggregate scores, we split the sample of 50 respondents into three

profitability the confluence of obstacles retailers face can make the next steps daunting. as such, we believe there are three key areas that retailers can—and should—consider now to help create efficiencies while addressing the changing consumer: last-mile capabilities, reverse logistics, and social commerce. supply chain: last-mile capabilities season 30 consumer expectations and digital preferences that may create last-mile guzzles profits 31 32 as these preferences for conveniences remain, retailers are left grappling with high-touch (e.g., picking, packing, and processing) transactions that are often unprofitable. compounding the problem is that retailers may owe fees to third-party vendors that support the shopping journey with services, such as fit-predicting tools, product viewing technology, and financing. companies pay more to grow their revenue in these channels, which, in turn, shrinks their profits, all at a time when consumer spending will likely contract.

digital commerce offerings as a top growth opportunity. specifically, many see opportunities around social commerce, with six in 10 expecting consumers to purchase products directly on social media

more than half of leaders and laggards agree that social strategies for success 47 and social commerce in technologies to provide a seamless purchasing experience loyalty toward influencers can translate into loyalty toward brands unfortunately, this extends to influencer controversies. to hedge against such risks, brands should build a real strategy involving diverse influencers from different walks of life and geographies that reflect the changing consumer. social media influence more than 60% in the past decade51 61% only 38% 52 32% of americans have made a purchase on a social media platform in the past year53 summary despite the spate of bad economic news, the keyword among retailers is resiliency. they've done it before—not too long ago, during the worst pandemicrelated lockdowns and shortages— and they can do it again. market challenges will always be a factor, and retailers are learning that they cannot rely on traditional cost-cutting alone to navigate the latest downturn. instead, retailers should examine how they've been most productive in recent years, honing omnichannel, supply chain management, and digital commerce to protect margins and aim for profitability in the future. and the real x-factor is the rapidly evolving consumer. ensuring the consumer experience is at the heart of investments may be the key to prospering when the dust finally
